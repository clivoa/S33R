Does using the active scan of OWASP ZAP carries risk of causing permanent damage? I know that it would cause some kind of spam on the web log because the process is constantly sending message to the website, but should i tell the admin to delete the logs because it risk to make the website heavier? I would also appreciate any extra practical information surrounding this topic bcs i'm actually a management student and this was a part of information management so i'm really far from expert on this topic. submitted by /u/Grouchy_Mark5058 [link] [comments]",

    "title": "Security Implications of Reverse Proxy Placement",
    "summary": "Hello cyber folks! Curious of the community’s thoughts on a thought experiment i’ve been having: Say I have a reverse proxy (RP) on my network brokering a service i’m running. I see 3 deployment options: Use two separate physical servers. One to run the RP, and another to run the service. Connected via a layer-2 switch, router-on-a-stick, and upstream firewall. Use a hypervisor, run the RP on the same physical server as the service, but each within their own VM. Use containers, run the RP & service on the same physical server & OS (baremetal Debian for example) and use a docker bridge network to connect the two. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ In terms of security, i think 1 is the best, 2 is almost identical to 1 except for the threat of VM escape, and 3 is the least secure but potentially still production-viable if configured properly. I’d love to hear your thoughts on what’s best and the security implications of each. Also if you’d change anything about the deployment options above!
