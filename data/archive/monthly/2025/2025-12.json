    "title": "Risk Managers: Vulnerability SLAs and SLA Exception tracking questions",
    "summary": "Context : It is common for asset vulnerabilities from third parties reported as CVEs to have No Fix Available until well past our remediation SLA, especially in the case of Critical and High severities. We track all detected vulnerabilities through their lifecycles and report regularly (quarterly) on our remediation SLA rates as one of our Security Objectives KPIs. We are a very small company, and SOC overhead can sometimes be a challenge to our various engineering and DevOps teams. \"Get to the point already!\" I am wondering what processes you have in place or have experienced for Vulnerability SLA Exceptions, especially if you are in a SMB. We are developing our policy and procedures for creating, approving and monitoring SLA Exception requests. I have seen it suggested that a full Risk Review be performed, including identifying likelihood, impact, and compensating controls (many of which are simply in place by default as a result of our commitment to secure engineering principles). How much effort do you put into the SLA Exception process? A full risk review every time a new CVE comes up can be laborious for a small group. When do you do the SLA Exception, after the SLA has expired, or a couple of days before (making an assumption that the patch won't be available)? It seems that due to the extra overhead of performing a full risk review for a CVE (as it applies to SLA Exceptions) would be best done only if the SLA is sure to be missed. I suppose a case SHOULD be made that a risk review be done for every detected Vulnerability, regardless of whether the SLA will be missed? However, for a small (nay, tiny) company practicality must be a consideration. We automate initial triage and prioritize accordingly and address all fixable vulnerabilities immediately. What strategies can be used to effectively manage risk while not overburdening a small staff with frequent risk reviews? Is this a sensible approach? Critical/High vulnerabilities → Full risk assessment. Medium/Low vulnerabilities → Automated scoring + periodic sampling for manual review. Yeah...I slipped the scope of my original question a bit. I appreciate any thoughts or insights you can provide. submitted by /u/jeleyman [link] [comments]",

    "summary": "I work in the physico-chemical field, and over the years I’ve noticed something simple but surprisingly powerful: Nature stabilizes itself elegantly. Not with brute force, but through balance, geometry, feedback loops, and resonance. Molecules don’t hold together by “processing power.” Ecosystems don’t stay balanced through firewalls. They stabilize because their structure teaches them how to remain coherent even when stress builds up. I began wondering if technology could learn a similar principle. What if digital systems (cybersecurity, networks, devices, etc.) could balance their own entropy before it becomes chaos? That question eventually became a personal project. And this month, that project officially became patent-pending under the name BeeStable. I’m not here to advertise anything — I’m just really curious what people think about the idea of stability-driven technology. Has anyone else thought about whether nature’s stability patterns could apply to computing or security? Genuinely interested in hearing perspectives, critiques, or references if you’ve seen similar research. Read you later ☺️ submitted by /u/OpeningMango5089 [link] [comments]",

    "summary": "I'm just looking for someone to ELI5 to me what's occuring here, since I'm genuinely confused. We have an employee who used to be the biggest target of spam & phishing in the company, and who left to join another firm only to return again recently. Given the problems his original email address dealt with (which was never deactivated for client reasons), when he rejoined I set him up with a BRAND NEW address, although I did configure his old address to forward all mail to the new one for a few weeks before ultimately decommissioning it (only mentioning in case it's relevant). His old email address, which dated back a decade, appeared in double digit data breaches on haveibeenpwned.com, which was never a surprise, but his new address, which is less than 3 months old and never before used, nonetheless shows as having appeared in 3 data breaches (2024/2023/2018)??? Furthermore, strictly speaking in terms of looking for \"through-lines\", two of the three aren't part of the same data breaches the old original email address and are unique to this new one, AND none of them are companies or services he has EVER used. What is happening here? I feel like I'm having a \"woosh\" moment. Is this indicative of anything? Can it simply be explained by the temporary email forwarding? Or is it likely there are security vunerabilities currently being exploited within one of our databases? Or is this merely all a coincidence?

I am using the Log Activity area but: The search interface seems to have endless options, in fact the availabile columns total well over 400 options. The filtering on the same screen has 544 filter options This isn't intuitive either as sometimes I am selecting an option which I think relates to a simple IP range or something, and the options provided just aren't clear You then have options to Group By which I understand but the time to search, then to find it's just not presented well or the sheer range of columns mean you're not seeing important data makes it hard. I am trying to use AQL and honestly, at this point using AI to try to figure out as I am on some deadlines with this. There are saved searches and some reports that I have used as a basis, but they references lots of things like internal lists. Like, where RemoteIP != LIST123 or LogSourceID = 8378. So then I have o identify what this thing relates to. I feel like I am just lost here and struggling to retrieve workable result sets.

    "title": "Decoding high-bandwidth memory: A practical guide to GPU memory for fine-tuning AI models",
    "summary": "We've all been there. You've meticulously prepared your dataset and written your training script. You hit run , and your excitement builds, only to be crushed by the infamous error: CUDA out of memory. This is one of the most common roadblocks in AI development. Your GPU's High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) , is the high-speed memory that holds everything that's needed for computation, and running out of it is a hard stop. But how do you know how much you need? To build a clear foundation, we'll start by breaking down the HBM consumers on a single GPU and we'll present key strategies to reduce HBM consumption on a single GPU. Later, we'll explore advanced multi-GPU strategies like data and model parallelism that can help relieve memory pressure and scale your training in the cloud. Understanding HBM: What's using all the memory? When you fine-tune a model , your HBM is primarily consumed by three things: Model Weights : This is the most straightforward. It's the storage space required for the model's parameters—the \"brain\" that it uses to make predictions. A 7-billion parameter model loaded in 16-bit precision will take up roughly 14 GB before you even process a single piece of data. Optimizer States and Gradients : This is the overhead that's required for learning. To update the model's weights, the training process needs to calculate gradients (the direction of learning) and the optimizer (like the popular AdamW ) needs to store its own data to guide the training. In full fine-tuning, this can be the largest consumer of HBM. Activations and Batch Data : This is the most dynamic part. When your data (images, text, etc.) flows through the model's layers, the intermediate calculations, or activations , are stored in HBM. The memory needed here is directly proportional to your batch size. A larger batch size means more activations are stored simultaneously, which leads to faster training but much higher memory usage. Note : These calculations are theoretical minimums. Real-world frameworks add up to 30% overhead due to temporary buffers, kernel launches, and memory fragmentation . Although it's impossible to get a perfect number without experimentation, you can estimate your HBM needs with this general formula: Total HBM ≈ (Model Size) + (Optimizer States) + (Gradients) + (Activations) Further reading : See this excellent JAX e-book that covers these topics in great detail and even has some \"try it out yourself\" test questions . Example: Why full fine-tuning is so demanding To see why running out of memory is such a common problem, let's walk through a real-world example that I recently worked on: fine-tuning the medgemma-4b-it model , which has 4 billion parameters. Our script loads it in bfloat16 precision (2 bytes per parameter). First, let's calculate the static HBM footprint. This is the memory that's required just to load the model and prepare it for training, before you've even processed a single piece of data. Model Size : The memory that's needed to simply hold the model on the GPU. 4 billion parameters × 2 bytes/parameter = 8 GB Gradients and Optimizer States : The overhead for training every parameter with the AdamW optimizer. Gradients: 4 billion parameters × 2 bytes/parameter = 8 GB Optimizer States (AdamW): 2 × 4 billion parameters × 2 bytes/parameter = 16 GB Note : While AdamW is a popular optimizer, other optimizers, such as Adafactor and Lion, have different memory footprints. Adding these together gives us our baseline HBM cost for a full fine-tuning attempt: 8 GB (Model) + 8 GB (Gradients) + 16 GB (Optimizer) = 32 GB This 32 GB is the baseline just to start the training process. On top of this, the GPU needs additional memory for activations , which is a dynamic cost that grows with your batch size and input data size. This is why full fine-tuning of large models is so demanding and often reserved for the most powerful hardware. Key strategies to reduce HBM consumption The HBM requirement for a full fine-tune can seem impossibly high. But several powerful techniques can reduce memory consumption, making it feasible to train large models on consumer-grade or entry-level professional GPUs. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) with LoRA Instead of training all the billions of parameters in a model, Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods focus on training only a small subset of parameters. The most popular of these is LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) . LoRA works by freezing the original model's weights and injecting a tiny number of new, trainable adapter layers into the model architecture. This means the memory-hungry gradients and optimizer states are only needed for these few million new parameters, not the full 4 billion. The math behind LoRA's memory savings LoRA doesn't remove the base model from your GPU. The full 8 GB of the original model's weights are still loaded and taking up HBM. They're just frozen, which means that the GPU isn't training them. All of the memory savings come from the fact that you no longer need to store the huge gradients and optimizer states for that massive, frozen part of the model. Let's recalculate the static HBM footprint with LoRA, assuming it adds 20 million trainable parameters: Model Size (unchanged) : The base model is still loaded. 4 billion parameters × 2 bytes/parameter = 8 GB LoRA Gradients & Optimizer States : We now only need overhead for the tiny set of new parameters. Gradients: 20 million parameters × 2 bytes/parameter = 40 MB Optimizer States: 2 × 20 million parameters × 2 bytes/parameter = 80 MB The new static HBM footprint is now: 8 GB (Model) + 40 MB (Gradients) + 80 MB (Optimizer) ≈ 8.12 GB The training overhead has shrunk from 24 GB to just 120 MB. Your new baseline memory requirement is now just over 8 GB. This lower baseline memory requirement leaves much more room for the dynamic memory that's needed for activations, which lets you use a reasonable batch size on a common 16 GB or 24 GB GPU without running out of memory. Model quantization Besides training fewer parameters, we can also shrink the ones that we have by using quantization , which involves reducing the numerical precision of the model's weights. T he standard precision for modern training is bfloat16 because it offers the dynamic range of float32 with half the memory footprint. But we can reduce HBM usage further by converting weights to lower-precision integer formats like int8 or int4. Using lower-precision integer formats has a significant impact on HBM when compared to the standard bfloat16 baseline: bfloat16 (standard): The baseline size (e.g., a 7B model requires ~14 GB ). 8-bit precision: Halves the model size (e.g., 14 GB becomes ~7 GB ). 4-bit precision: Reduces the model size by a factor of 4 (e.g., 14 GB becomes ~3.5 GB ). The reduction in size lets you fit much larger models into memory with minimal degradation in performance. aside_block ), ('btn_text', ''), ('href', ''), ('image', None)])]> Combining LoRA and Quantization : These techniques work best together. Quantized LoRA ( QLoRA) is a method that stores the massive base model in a highly efficient 4-bit format (specifically NF4 or NormalFloat 4), while adding small, trainable LoRA adapters in bfloat16. During the training process, the 4-bit weights are dequantized to bfloat16 for computation. Dequantizing in process lets you fine-tune very large models on a single GPU with the memory savings of 4-bit storage and the mathematical stability of 16-bit training. FlashAttention: An algorithmic speed boost Finally, FlashAttention is a foundational algorithmic optimization that significantly reduces HBM usage and speeds up training on both single and multi-GPU setups. The attention mechanism in transformers is a primary memory bottleneck because it requires storing a large, intermediate attention matrix . FlashAttention cleverly reorders the computation to avoid storing this full matrix in memory, leading to substantial memory savings and faster execution. Best of all, enabling FlashAttention is often as simple as a one-line change. In the MedGemma fine-tuning script , this was done by setting the value attn_implementation=\"sdpa\" , which can automatically use more efficient backends like FlashAttention if the hardware supports it. Scaling beyond a single GPU: Advanced strategies Techniques like LoRA and quantization are useful for lowering HBM needs on a single GPU. But to train truly massive models or to really speed up the process, you'll eventually need to scale out to multiple GPUs. Here are some of the key strategies that can be used to distribute the load and overcome memory limitations. Data parallelism Data parallelism is the most common and intuitive approach to scaling. In a Distributed Data Parallel (DDP) setup, the entire model is replicated on each GPU. The key is that the global batch of training data is split, with each GPU processing its own mini-batch concurrently. After each forward and backward pass, the gradients from each GPU are averaged together to ensure that all of the model replicas learn from the entire dataset and they stay in sync. This method is excellent for speeding up training but it doesn't reduce the HBM that's required to hold the model itself, because every GPU needs a full copy. Model parallelism When a model is too large to fit into the memory of a single GPU, you must use model parallelism . Instead of replicating the model, this strategy splits the model across multiple GPUs. There are two primary ways to do this: Tensor parallelism : This method splits a single large operation (like a massive weight matrix in a transformer layer) across several GPUs. Each GPU computes its part of the operation, and the results are combined. Pipeline parallelism : This technique places different layers of the model onto different GPUs in a sequence. The data flows through the first set of layers on GPU 1, then the output is passed to GPU 2 for the next set of layers, and so on, like an assembly line. These strategies are more complex to implement than data parallelism, but they're essential for models that are simply too big for one device. Fully Sharded Data Parallelism (FSDP) FSDP is a powerful and efficient hybrid strategy that combines the ideas of data parallelism and model parallelism. Unlike standard data parallelism where each GPU holds a full copy of the model, optimizer states, and gradients, FSDP shards (or splits) all of these components across the GPUs. Each GPU only materializes the full parameters for the specific layer that it's computing at that moment, dramatically reducing the peak HBM usage per device. FSDP makes it possible to train enormous models on a cluster of smaller GPUs. By combining these hardware and software strategies, you can scale your fine-tuning jobs from a single GPU to a powerful, distributed cluster capable of handling even the most demanding AI models. HBM sizing guide HBM Use case and explanation 16 GB Sufficient for basic inference or fine-tuning with techniques like LoRA using a very small batch size (e.g., 1-2). Expect slower training times at this level. 24 GB The recommended starting point for a good experience with 4-7 B parameter models. This capacity allows for a more effective batch size (e.g., 8-16) when using LoRA, providing a great balance of training speed and cost. 40+ GB Necessary for maximizing training speed with large batch sizes or for working with larger models (in the 20+ B parameter range) now or in the future. Encountering the CUDA out of memory error provides an important lesson in the trade-offs between model size, training techniques, and batch size. By understanding what consumes your HBM, you can make smarter decisions and keep your projects running smoothly.

    "summary": "I am a technical writer in cybersecurity and graduated in 2022. Since then, I've worked at two of the leading identity security companies and will soon be acquired by a Fortune 500 cybersecurity company. Tech writing is very threatened by AI. Thankfully, I am more of a doc engineer right now, where I write in a docs-as-code environment, I'm good at Git and CI/CD pipelines, and I leverage AI in meaningful ways in my career. Tech writing hits a ceiling very quickly, and the remote job market to make a decent salary is hyper competitive. I'm planning to move to GRC for better growth opportunities, higher salary prospects, job security, and impactful work. The bulk of my job is communicating with different stakeholders in the company, gathering technical info, and translating it into user-friendly docs. I love the communication, detective work, and docs that my job has, and I want to apply this in GRC by impacting security posture and not just end users. Here are my resume points so far: ● Collaborate with security engineers, product managers, and developers via Jira to gather technical information and distill it for user-friendly certificate lifecycle management documentation. ● Author and maintain cloud-based documentation in a Docs-as-Code environment using Markdown and Git Bash CLI, integrated with CI/CD pipelines to ensure version control, scalability, and fast iteration. ● Automate document linting with Python scripts to detect style deviations, broken links, and test code snippets to streamline the editorial process and ensure documentation stays up to date. ● Build tailored AI agents for style checking, UX writing, and persona-based usability testing simulations. ● Lead quarterly content audits informed by user testing and internal feedback, restructuring documentation for improved navigation, clarity, and user confidence. ● Wrote installation guides, online help, developer guides, and release notes for IAM cloud software with MadCap Flare and Adobe FrameMaker. ● Led department meetings to improve SME communication strategies and tooling innovations. ● Documented SOAP and REST API reference guides to simplify API handling for developer audiences. ● Directed usability testing with 30 internal users, presenting findings to engineering, product, and sales directors to drive UX improvements and secure funding for future research. ● Managed department knowledge base content to simplify processes and efficiently teach writers. ● Conducted risk gap analysis on third-party AI tools against NIST AI RMF and NIST 800-53 to validate vendor compliance. ● Executed Data Loss Prevention (DLP) audits on documentation, redacting sensitive data to prevent information leakage and ensure legal compliance. I've had zero luck getting interviews, but I've had some cold messages lead to a few close calls. I really want to pursue the GRC engineering side of the career, as my current tech writing/DevOps familiarity has some similarities. I really want to lean into the AI governance and risk category as well because I could see AI security issues and compliance exploding as enterprises are now adopting these tools. Do I have a chance? Does the market need to heat up again first? Would love your advice. submitted by /u/buzzlightyear0473 [link] [comments]",

The risk for enterprises is significant if any of those browsers are on work PCs or on employees’ own devices used to access work resources, Koi warned. “Infected developer workstations mean compromised repositories and stolen API keys,” security researcher Tuval Admoni said in a post on the Koi Security blog . “Browser-based authentication to SaaS platforms, cloud consoles, and internal tools means every login is visible to ShadyPanda.” The malicious extensions are no longer being distributed, but organizations with infected machines remain at risk: “Even though the extensions were recently removed from marketplaces, the infrastructure for full scale attacks remains deployed on all infected browsers,” Admoni said. Multi-year campaign with shifting motives Koi’s analysis shows that ShadyPanda maintained a multi-year, multi-generational infrastructure of browser extensions dating back to 2017. The group cycled through dozens of extensions, with 20 published to the Chrome Web Store and 125 distributed for Edge. The earliest extensions focused on affiliate fraud, extracting hidden commissions on victims’ online purchases, later shifting to search-result manipulation. Most recently, they have included sophisticated behavioral tracking, session-data harvesting, and browser fingerprinting surveillance affecting 4 million users, and a backdoor supporting remote code execution (RCE) affecting 300,000. ShadyPanda played the long game, with extensions including the popular Clean Master utility with 200,000 installs distributed as completely legitimate tools early on, earning them positive user ratings and, in some cases, trust signals such as “Featured” or “Verified” badges in the Chrome Web Store and Microsoft Edge Add-ons store. No review after submission This long-term legitimacy built a large user base and may have normalized these extensions inside enterprises, where browser add-ons often pass through with little scrutiny. Only after accumulating trust, and millions of installs, did ShadyPanda push silent malicious updates. It embedded hidden install-tracking routines that mapped user behavior and optimized reach before weaponizing it through a malicious update. Because Chrome and Edge updates occur automatically and do not require user re-approval for existing permissions, the exploit happened quietly. “ShadyPanda’s success is about systematically exploiting the same vulnerability for seven years: Marketplaces review extensions at submission,” Admoni said. “They don’t watch what happens after approval.” Evasion and Man-in-the-Browser tricks ShadyPanda also invested in staying hidden. Koi found that when developer tools were opened, the malicious logic immediately switched to benign behavior, making manual analysis harder. Obfuscation and controlled activation further obscured the malicious component, ensuring stealth. Koi noted that some of these extensions were still live in the Edge Add-ons store at the time of disclosure. Clean Master’s publisher, Starlab Technology, launched 5 additional extensions on Microsoft Edge around 2023, picking up over 4 million combined installs. “All 5 extensions are still live in Microsoft Edge marketplace,” Admoni said, adding that two of those are comprehensive spyware. Google recently removed Clean Master from the Chrome Web Store, and today none of the extensions are available on Chrome Web Store, a Google spokesman said. Microsoft did not immediately respond to CSO’s request for comment. Like in a man-in-the-middle ( MitM ) style attack, ShadyPanda effectively positioned itself between users and the websites they visited, inserting tracking logic into pages they loaded. This allowed the attackers to observe and manipulate traffic through the browser, giving the actor continuous visibility into how infected users interacted with the web. Admoni pointed out that removing the extensions might not help as, presumably, the attackers may already have collected high-value data including cookies, browsing patterns, session tokens, fingerprinting data, etc. In its blog post, Koi provided a list of malicious Chrome and Edge extensions, along with C2 and data exfiltration domains to support detection efforts.",

    "title": "Is my release process SOC2 compliant?",
    "summary": "Hi, I work as a software developer for a small start-up that's looking to do SOC2. The bulk of our SOC2 stuff is going to be done by the IT admin I work with, but as I understand it, the auditors will also look at how our software product is actually released to production. That's my area of responsibility. I want to check with the crowd if our release process is compliant with SOC2. Here is how we do releases to prod now: - Our software product is an application that lives in its own \"application\" repo on GitHub. It has a protected \"main\" branch that requires all new merges to go through a manual peer review process, accompanied by a battery of automated tests. Nothing gets merged into main until it's approved and passed all tests. - Every time there is a new commit on main, we automatically build a docker image and push it to a AWS ECR. - For managing infra and actual deployments, we have a separate repo called \"infra\". This holds all the Terraform stuff, as well as some Python scripts for deploying new revisions of the application image. The script is literally `python deploy.py -- env [staging | prod] --application-image-id [image_tag]`. - All developers on my small team have access to the infra repo & the deploy script. Once the product manager decides it's time to release, one of the developers picks the correct image from the ECR, and updates prod with it (we use AWS ECS for container orchestration). - The deploy script is wrapped in a GitHub Action. So the workflow is \"pick image -> go to infra repo -> manually dispatch deployment GitHub action with new image sha\". The approval for release is not really documented anywhere, and any logging that happens here is whatever AWS cloud trail generates when our deploy script calls AWS SDK. --- I think the continuous integration of our setup is solid. We maintain a library of releasable images in ECR, and I can point the auditor to the thousands of reviewed and tested pull requests in the application repo. I am not so sure about the release process. My LLM is telling me my releases need to be \"documented & authorized\". The LLM is suggesting I make image id of what's running in prod a part of the infra repo. As in, my deploy script should consume not something developers enter manually into it ad hoc, but a string from a version-controlled config file. So if a developer wants to update prod, they change the config file and create a pull request. Once PR gets approved, the deployment script runs automatically with the updated config file. The PR would be the \"documented & authorized\" artifact. Is that about right? PS Before you ask \"why the hell is your image id not already part of the Terraform config!!!\", we use AWS ECS to orchestrate containers, and Terraform is very-very good at setting up ECS infra, but it's not very good at doing actual _deployments_ of new images to ECS . So I made a conscious decision of splitting deployment pipe into its own python script. submitted by /u/OtherwiseUniversity7 [link] [comments]",

    "title": "Cyber Startup Frenetik Launches with Patented Deception Technology That Bets Against the AI Arms Race",
    "summary": "While most cybersecurity companies pour resources into AI models, massive compute, hoovering up all the data, and enhanced analytics to detect and prevent threats, Frenetik , a Maryland cyber startup, is betting on something simpler: making sure attackers don’t know what defenders know. The company emerged today with a fundamentally different approach using novel cyber deception and a newly issued U.S. patent to back it. “The industry has turned cybersecurity into a compute and analysis war,” said founder Hans Ismirnioglou. “Bigger models, more data, faster analysis. But you can’t out-compute or out-analyze an adversary forever. We’re not trying to. We’re exploiting information asymmetry.” Traditional deception tools deploy fake systems, wait for attackers to find them, and hope they interact. Frenetik’s patented “Deception In-Use” technology (U.S. Patent 12,463,981 – “Systems and Methods for Counter-Reconnaissance in Cloud Infrastructure to Disrupt Adversarial Targeting”) takes a different path: it continuously rotates actually used identities and resources across Microsoft Entra (M365), AWS, Google Cloud, and on-premises environments. The critical details of who changed, what changed, when, where, and how travel through out-of-band channels accessible only to trusted parties. Defenders stay informed. Attackers work from stale intelligence. “Adversaries, especially AI-driven ones, build models based on reconnaissance. They assume the environment they mapped earlier is the environment they’ll exploit today,” Ismirnioglou explained. “We break that assumption without needing a bigger GPU cluster by simply depriving them of easily discoverable information.” Users can think of it as musical chairs for hackers: by the time they figure out where to sit, everything has moved—and only defenders know which chairs are real and which have become traps. The technology transforms existing deception tools from passive traps into active ones. When Frenetik rotates real resources, attackers following stale intelligence get funneled straight into honeypots and decoys, supercharging interaction rates with classic deception elements that previously only hoped to look real. Unlike solutions requiring extensive tuning or analyst oversight, Frenetik works because attackers simply lack the information needed to know the difference. “I want the adversary to have to continuously put a dedicated body onto every target they go after – no more free lunches or easy days for America’s adversaries,” says Ismirnioglou. About Frenetik Frenetik, a Maryland-based cybersecurity startup, just emerged from stealth with a new approach: instead of flooding defenders with more data, it starves attackers of the information they need to move. Focused on measurable security outcomes, and pricing transparency, Frenetik is built to tip the balance of power by denying adversaries trustworthy insight into targeted environments.

It is a technology that in theory amplifies the power of its users: A manager, marketer, political campaigner, or opinionated internet user can utter a single instruction, and see their message—whatever it is—instantly written, personalized, and propagated via email, text, social, or other channels to thousands of people within their organization, or millions around the world.

    "title": "AI Adoption Surges While Governance Lags — Report Warns of Growing Shadow Identity Risk",
    "summary": "The 2025 State of AI Data Security Report reveals a widening contradiction in enterprise security: AI adoption is nearly universal, yet oversight remains limited. Eighty-three percent of organizations already use AI in daily operations, but only 13 percent say they have strong visibility into how these systems handle sensitive data. Produced by Cybersecurity Insiders with research support from Cyera Research Labs , the study reflects responses from 921 cybersecurity and IT professionals across industries and organization sizes. The data shows AI increasingly behaving as an ungoverned identity — a non-human user that reads faster, accesses more, and operates continuously. Yet most organizations still use human-centric identity models that break down at machine speed. As a result, two-thirds have caught AI tools over-accessing sensitive information, and 23 percent admit they have no controls for prompts or outputs. Autonomous AI agents stand out as the most exposed frontier. Seventy-six percent of respondents say these agents are the hardest systems to secure, while 57 percent lack the ability to block risky AI actions in real time. Visibility remains thin: nearly half report no visibility into AI usage and another third say they have only minimal insight — leaving most enterprises unsure where AI is operating or what data it touches. Governance structures lag behind adoption as well. Only 7 percent of organizations have a dedicated AI governance team, and just 11 percent feel prepared to meet emerging regulatory requirements, underscoring how quickly readiness gaps are widening. The report calls for a shift toward data-centric AI oversight with continuous discovery of AI use, real-time monitoring of prompts and outputs, and identity policies that treat AI as a distinct actor with narrowly scoped access driven by data sensitivity. “AI is no longer just another tool — it’s acting as a new identity inside the enterprise, one that never sleeps and often ignores boundaries,” said Holger Schulze with Cybersecurity Insiders. “Without visibility and robust governance, enterprises will keep finding their data in places it was never meant to be.” As the report cautions: “You cannot secure an AI agent you do not identify, and you cannot govern what you cannot see.” The full 2025 State of AI Data Security Report is available for download at: https://www.cybersecurity-insiders.com/portfolio/2025-state-of-ai-data-security-report-cyera/ Media Contact: Andrea.Chilkott@cybersecurity-insiders.com About Cybersecurity Insiders Cybersecurity Insiders provides strategic insight for security leaders, grounded in more than a decade of independent research and trusted by a global community of 600,000 cybersecurity professionals.

    "title": "Microsoft Silently Patched CVE-2025-9491 - We Think Our Patch Provides More Security",
    "summary": "Patching What You See vs. Patching What You Execute Summary : Trend Micro discovered that attackers have long been using a trick to hide what a Windows shortcut actually does, preventing users from seeing malicious commands. Microsoft decided this was not patch-worthy. Others then found this same trick still being exploited, and the issue got a CVE. Microsoft doubled down, but silently patched the issue so that malicious commands can no longer be hidden. We created a different patch that actually blocks discovered attacks. The story - or at least its public part - begins on March 18, 2025, with Trend Micro's publication of Advisory ZDI-25-148 and an associated article titled Windows Shortcut Exploit Abused as Zero-Day in Widespread APT Campaigns . This article by Peter Girnus and Aliakbar Zahravi describes how they observed close to a thousand malicious Windows shortcut (.lnk) files being used in various offensive campaigns dating back to 2017. These shortcut files were crafted such that viewing their properties in Windows, one could not see the entire commands the shortcuts executed. The trick was an old one: using various \"whitespace\" characters to move the malicious part of the command out of user's sight. For instance, the article shows how Windows 11 would show properties of a shortcut file with a target like this: conhost.exe calc.exe Windows 11 showing an obfuscated target in a Windows shortcut (Image borrowed from Trend Micro's article) As you can see, the Target field shows only space characters (selected, therefore in blue), and even scrolling left or right would not reveal the presence of \" calc.exe \", or whatever malicious command there might be at the end. Instead of space characters, various other characters could be used to achieve a similar effect. As Peter and Aliakbar explained, Microsoft was notified about this issue but decided it didn't meet their bar for servicing. In other words, they would not consider it a vulnerability worth patching. At this point we have to admit we (too?) misunderstood the problem Trend Micro was presenting in April. We thought the issue was just that padding a malicious command with spaces would not show the malicious command in the dialog because the dialog always showed the end of the command - and when padded with spaces, the end is just all spaces. We considered that a bit silly as the user could always scroll back to the start of the field and see everything - and we found Microsoft's decision to not fix this reasonable, albeit the trick was actually being used in malicious campaigns. After all, what could be done? One can't ban whitespace characters from the command string, and if the Properties dialog showed the beginning of the target instead of the end, malicious code could then be hidden at the end. In addition to these technical details, there was also a social engineering aspect: what profile of user gets a PDF-lookalike Windows shortcut file, checks its properties, sees something like \" powershell.exe \" - without the hidden malicious arguments - and based on that still decides to double-click it? Most users, we thought, would either be non-IT persons and not look at properties at all, or would be somewhat IT persons and probably concerned by seeing some script there, likely also scrolling left and right in the Target field to see the whole thing. Following this reasoning, we also decided not to patch this issue. Case closed. Until end of October, that is, when Arctic Wolf published an article titled UNC6384 Weaponizes ZDI-CAN-25373 Vulnerability to Deploy PlugX Against Hungarian and Belgian Diplomatic Entities . UNC6384 is code name for a Chinese-affiliated threat actor, and ZDI-CAN-25373 is Trend Micro's working ID for the described issue. Arctic Wolf identified a campaign by threat actor UNC6384 specifically targeting Hungarian and Belgian diplomatic entities during September and October 2025 - using Windows shortcuts exploiting the described vulnerability. This discovery revived the interest in this issue, which was by then assigned CVE-2025-9491 . Microsoft was under some heat in the media for not having patched this exploited-in-the-wild issue yet, but they doubled-down with and advisory titled Microsoft Guidance on CVE-2025-9491 Windows LNK File UI Behavior . In this advisory, Microsoft claimed that \" during the user experience, the user is warned several times that proceeding may be harmful. \" Now, \" several times \" is a bit of an exaggeration for what must have been just once in described actual attacks, but fact is, if one downloads a .lnk file from the Internet (which has to be packaged in a ZIP archive as browsers deliberately mangle its file name to protect users), it will have Mark of the Web and double-clicking it will warn the user about opening a potentially harmful file from the Internet. That is, unless the attacker knows of some vulnerability that bypasses Mark of the Web like this one . The advisory concludes: \" Due to the user interaction involved and the fact that the system already warns users that this format is untrusted, Microsoft does not consider this a vulnerability. \" Having read this advisory with our then-current understanding of the issue, we still agreed with Microsoft's conclusion. But then we looked again. And finally saw what the issue really was: it was not just the sliding of malicious content out of the Target field's default focus. Instead, a .lnk file structure allows the Target arguments to be a very long string (tens of thousands of characters), but the Properties dialog only shows the first 260 characters , silently cutting off the rest. So it is possible to construct a .lnk file that runs a reeeeealy long PowerShell or BAT script, but only the first 260 characters of it would be shown to the user who viewed its properties. And these characters could be mostly \"whitespace\" characters to push the interesting bits entirely out of the Target field - even if the user scrolled to the very end. Now this makes it more interesting: it's now a matter of trust in the user interface. The string that Windows are showing to you -- is not the entire string that will actually be executed. Even if you're an IT person, you can be fooled by this issue because you rightfully expect the UI can be trusted to show you the whole command. This did look patch-worthy, so we decided to analyze the issue deeper in order to come up with a good patch. While we were developing our patch, the November Patch Tuesday brought new Windows Updates. And as expected (\" Microsoft does not consider this a vulnerability \"), there was no mention of anything remotely akin to this issue among its 63 patched vulnerabilities . However... Microsoft's Patch However, we noticed something did change with November Windows Updates: now, the Properties dialog of a .lnk file shows the entire Target command with arguments, no matter how long it is. The theoretically-up-to-32k-character-long string is now shown in the same single-line field that can't even reveal an entire modest-sized command without selecting some text and moving the mouse left or right. But okay, at least one can select all, copy and paste the string to a text editor. The issue was apparently demoted from vulnerability to functional bug, silently fixed without an advisory, and trust in the user interface was restored. Arguably, if the problem was defined as \"The properties dialog does not always show exactly what will be executed,\" it would indeed have been resolved. But this approach was weird: namely, it has always been the case that the \"ordinary\" way to create or modify a Windows shortcut - via Explorer user interface - only allowed you to enter up to 260 characters to the Target field. The only way for this string to be longer is to create the shortcut programmatically, e.g. using Windows API . (And some application may be creating such legitimate shortcuts for its own use.) So how much would showing all Target characters in a small field improve chances for victims targeted in actual attacks? Our Patch We decided to take a different route: Our premise was that a legitimate non-malicious .lnk file that regular Windows users come across would be created manually and would therefore never have a Target with more than 260 characters. However, we still accept that shortcut files with more than 260 character Target can be valid, just not meant for manual opening by users. Consequently, our patch has the following logic: If the process opening the .lnk file is Windows Explorer, AND the Target has more than 260 characters, then we cut the Target at 260 characters and alert the user that a suspicious .lnk file was shortened. Our patch would break the 1000+ malicious shortcuts identified by Trend Micro for all targeted users, while Microsoft's patch would only allow the most cautious among these users - who would probably not launch such shortcuts anyway - to see the entire malicious command string. Even though malicious shortcuts could be constructed with fewer than 260 characters, we believe disrupting actual attacks detected in the wild can make a big difference for those targeted. Let's see our patch in action. On the video below you can see that a shortcut file looking like a PDF document has a Target that doesn't fully show in the Properties dialog, while a hex editor reveals its full content. Launching it with 0patch disabled results in spawning the calculator (which was hidden from the Properties dialog), but launching it with 0patch enabled results in a security notification and the execution of only the first 260 characters of the shortcut's Target.

Vulnerabilities like these get discovered on a regular basis, and attackers know about them all. If you're using Windows that aren't receiving official security updates anymore, 0patch will make sure these vulnerabilities won't be exploited on your computers - and you won't even have to know or care about these things. If you're new to 0patch , create a free account in 0patch Central , start a free trial, then install and register 0patch Agent. Everything else will happen automatically. No computer reboot will be needed.

    "title": "Security Guidance Series: CAF 4.0 Building Proactive Cyber Resilience",
    "summary": "It’s Time To Act Microsoft's Digital Defense Report 2025 clearly describes the cyber threat landscape that this guidance is situated in, one that has become more complex, more industrialized, and increasingly democratized. Each day, Microsoft processes more than 100 trillion security signals, giving unparalleled visibility into adversarial tradecraft. Identity remains the most heavily targeted attack vector, with 97% of identity-based attacks relying on password spray, while phishing and unpatched assets continue to provide easy routes for initial compromise. Financially motivated attacks, particularly ransomware and extortion, now make up over half of global incidents, and nation-state operators continue to target critical sectors, including IT, telecommunications, and Government networks. AI is accelerating both sides of the equation: enhancing attacker capability, lowering barriers to entry through open-source models, and simultaneously powering more automated, intelligence-driven defence. Alongside this, emerging risks such as quantum computing underline the urgency of preparing today for tomorrow’s threats. Cybersecurity has therefore become a strategic imperative shaping national resilience and demanding genuine cross-sector collaboration to mitigate systemic risk. It is within this environment that UK public sector organizations are rethinking their approach to cyber resilience. As an Account Executive Apprentice in the Local Public Services team here at Microsoft, I have seen how UK public sector organizations are rethinking their approach to cyber resilience, moving beyond checklists and compliance toward a culture of continuous improvement and intelligence-led defence. When we talk about the UK public sector in this series, we are referring specifically to central government departments, local government authorities, health and care organizations (including the NHS), education institutions, and public safety services such as police, fire, and ambulance. These organizations form a deeply interconnected ecosystem delivering essential services to millions of citizens every day, making cyber resilience not just a technical requirement but a foundation of public trust. Against this backdrop, the UK public sector is entering a new era of cyber resilience with the release of CAF 4.0 , the latest evolution of the National Cyber Security Centre’s Cyber Assessment Framework. This guidance has been developed in consultation with national cyber security experts, including the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), and is an aggregation of knowledge and internationally recognized expertise. Building on the foundations of CAF 3.2, this update marks a decisive shift, like moving from a static map to a live radar. Instead of looking back at where threats once were, organizations can now better anticipate them and adjust their digital defences in real time. For the UK’s public sector, this transformation could not be timelier. The complexity of digital public services, combined with the growing threat of ransomware, insider threat, supply chain compromise, and threats from nation state actors, demands a faster, smarter, and more connected approach to resilience. Where CAF 3.2 focused on confirming the presence and effectiveness of security measures, CAF 4.0 places greater emphasis on developing organizational capability and improving resilience in a more dynamic threat environment. While the CAF remains an outcome-based framework, not a maturity model, it is structured around Objectives, Principles, and Contributing Outcomes, with each contributing outcome supported by Indicators of Good Practice. For simplicity, I refer to these contributing outcomes as “controls” throughout this blog and use that term to describe the practical expectations organizations are assessed against. CAF 4.0 challenges organizations not only to understand the threats they face but to anticipate, detect, and respond in a more informed and adaptive way. Two contributing outcomes exemplify this proactive mindset: A2.b Understanding Threat and C2 Threat Hunting. Together, they represent what it truly means to understand your adversaries and act before harm occurs. For the UK’s public sector, achieving these new objectives may seem daunting, but the path forward is clearer than ever. Many organizations are already beginning this journey, supported by technologies that help turn insight into action and coordination into resilience. At Microsoft, we’ve seen how tools like E3, E5, and Sentinel are already helping public sector teams to move from reactive to intelligence-driven security operations. Over the coming weeks, we’ll explore how these capabilities align to CAF 4.0’s core principles and share practical examples of how councils can strengthen their resilience journey through smarter visibility, automation, and collaboration. CAF 4.0 vs CAF 3.2 - What’s Changed and Why It Matters The move from CAF 3.2 to CAF 4.0 represents a fundamental shift in how the UK public sector builds cyber resilience. The focus is no longer on whether controls exist - it is on whether they work, adapt, and improve over time. CAF 4.0 puts maturity at the centre. It pushes organizations to evolve from compliance checklists to operational capability, adopting a threat-informed, intelligence-led, and proactive security posture, by design. CAF 4.0 raises the bar for cyber maturity across the public sector. It calls for departments and authorities to build on existing foundations and embrace live threat intelligence, behavioural analytics, and structured threat hunting to stay ahead of adversaries. By understanding how attackers might target essential services and adapting controls in real time, organizations can evolve from awareness to active defence. Today’s threat actors are agile, persistent, and increasingly well-resourced, which means reactive measures are no longer enough. CAF 4.0 positions resilience as a continuous process of learning, adapting, and improving, supported by data-driven insights and modern security operations. CAF 4.0 is reshaping how the UK’s public sector approaches security maturity. In the coming weeks, we’ll explore what this looks like in practice, starting with how to build a deeper understanding of threat (control A2.b) and elevate threat hunting (control C2) into an everyday capability, using the tools and insights that are available within existing Microsoft E3 and E5 licences to help support these objectives. Until then, how ready is your organization to turn insight into action?",

Aus Sicht von Experten und des Bundesamtes für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik (BSI) muss der Schutz in diesem Bereich massiv erhöht werden. Wie beurteilen Sie die aktuelle Lage in Deutschland? Reiß: Die geopolitischen Spannungen, die wir aktuell sehen, führen zu einer erhöhten Bedrohungslage. Das betrifft natürlich auch die Heizungsbranche, in der Vaillant tätig ist und die das Grundbedürfnis aller Menschen nach Wärme und Warmwasser zu Hause erfüllt. Solche Bereiche müssen auf jeden Fall verstärkt geschützt werden. Das Problem ist, dass die Angriffe immer gezielter und komplexer werden. Heutzutage haben wir es nicht mehr mit den weniger erfahrenen Script Kiddies aus dem heimischen Keller, sondern mittlerweile mit gut organisierten und professionellen Cyberkriminellen zu tun. Ziel ist es, dem Unternehmen beziehungsweise der Wirtschaft des jeweiligen Landes zu schaden. Hinzu kommt, dass die Eintrittsschwelle für Angriffe auf Unternehmen und die Lieferkette durch die Nutzung von künstlicher Intelligenz im Unternehmen viel geringer als je zuvor ist. Dadurch wird es beispielsweise einfacher, gezielte Phishing-E-Mails zu verfassen oder Malware zu entwickeln, was zuvor mit deutlich höherem Aufwand verbunden war. Wie reagieren Sie auf die veränderte Situation? Wie schützen Sie Ihr Unternehmen aktuell vor Cyberattacken? Reiß: Wir verfolgen einen ganzheitlichen Ansatz in der Informationssicherheit. Das bedeutet, wir schauen uns wirklich alle Themen von oben bis unten an und setzen auf ein mehrschichtiges Sicherheitskonzept. Dabei werden sowohl präventive als auch reaktive Sicherheitsmaßnahmen einbezogen, um im Ernstfall schnell und effektiv reagieren zu können. Dabei ist uns bewusst: Kein Unternehmen kann absolute Sicherheit garantieren. Deshalb sollte jeder mit der Annahme planen, dass ein erfolgreicher Angriff jederzeit möglich ist. Wir legen nicht nur Wert auf die Absicherung unserer internen IT-Landschaft, sondern auf unsere weltweite Produktion und Produkte für unsere Kunden. Dabei stehen der Schutz unserer Endkunden und die Einhaltung hoher Sicherheitsstandards für uns im Mittelpunkt – insbesondere angesichts der wachsenden Bedrohung durch Ransomware-Angriffe. Unser Fokus liegt darauf, proaktiv Risiken zu minimieren und das Vertrauen in unsere Lösungen langfristig zu sichern. Und die Mitarbeiter? Cybersicherheit beginnt beim Menschen. Durch die globale Vernetzung bei Vaillant legen wir in Sachen Security ganz klar den Fokus darauf. Durch unseren holistischen 4-Säulen-Ansatz setzen wir auf eine umfassende Sensibilisierung unserer gesamten Belegschaft, von Gamification-Ansätzen bis hin zu praxisnahen Compliance-Schulungen. Dabei greifen wir auch Themen aus dem privaten Umfeld auf, wie etwa Phishing-Beispiele einiger Telekommunikationsunternehmen oder Paketzustelldienste, um die Relevanz zu erhöhen und nachhaltige Lernprozesse zu fördern. Welche Herausforderungen machen CISOs aktuell am meisten zu schaffen? Reiß: Zunächst einmal: Die Rolle des CISO hat sich in den vergangenen Jahren grundlegend gewandelt. Früher lag der Fokus primär auf technischen Aspekten und operativer Sicherheit. Heute sind strategische Ausrichtung und Leadership-Kompetenzen zentrale Schlüsselqualifikationen. Ein moderner CISO muss nicht nur technologische Risiken managen, sondern auch als Sparringspartner des Managements agieren, Business-Risiken bewerten und die Informationssicherheit als integralen Bestandteil der Unternehmensstrategie verankern.. Aus meiner Sicht liegen aktuell die größten Herausforderungen darin, die neuen gesetzlichen Vorgaben wie NIS2, DORA und Cyber Resilience Act umzusetzen. Ich bezeichne das Ganze als Regulatorik-Dschungel, der erst einmal verstanden werden muss. Wir bewegen uns in einem komplexen Regulierungsumfeld, das pragmatisch interpretiert und mit den richtigen Ressourcen umgesetzt werden muss. Am Ende geht es nicht nur darum, die Compliance zu gewährleisten, sondern das Sicherheitslevel im gesamten Unternehmen zu erhöhen, um eine erhöhte Resilienz zu schaffen. Haben wir zu viele Sicherheitsregeln? Reiß: In der Heizungsbranche sind die regulatorischen Anforderungen überschaubar, auch wenn NIS2 und weitere relevant sind. Grundsätzlich begrüße ich einheitliche Standards, da sie die Sicherheit in Deutschland und Europa erhöhen. Die Herausforderung liegt in der nationalen Umsetzung: Jedes Land interpretiert die Vorgaben unterschiedlich, was für international tätige Unternehmen eine erhebliche Komplexität bedeutet. Einheitliche und pragmatische Sicherheitsregeln für Europa zur Umsetzung zu entwicklen ist dem Gesetzgeber von NIS2 nicht gelungen. NIS2 wurde zwar auf EU-Ebene verabschiedet, muss aber in die lokale Gesetzgebung der jeweiligen Länder überführt werden. Das bedeutet, dass jedes Land seine eigene Interpretation mit einbringt. Organisationen, die europaweit tätig sind, müssen dabei jegliche Gesetzgebung auch in der jeweiligen Region berücksichtigen. An dieser Stelle ein standardisiertes Verfahren zu gewährleisten bedeutet zusätzliche Komplexität und hohen Abstimmungsaufwand. Warum kämpfen so viele Unternehmen aktuell noch bei der Umsetzung? Reiß: Oft fehlt die Klarheit bei der Auslegung der Vorgaben. Viele Unternehmen – insbesondere KMU – wissen nicht, ob sie überhaupt in den Geltungsbereich fallen. Hinzu kommen Fragen zur Ressourcenzuteilung: Soll die Umsetzung intern erfolgen oder mit externen Partnern? Wer übernimmt die Verantwortung – die IT, die Compliance-Abteilung oder ein dediziertes Security-Team? Zusätzlich mangelt es häufig an Reifegrad und Bewusstsein, wo und wie Cybersicherheit strategisch verankert werden muss, damit derartige Themen angemessen umgesetzt werden können. Diese Faktoren lähmen den Fortschritt und kosten Unternehmen entscheidende Zeit. Ein „Kochrezept“ für Regularien gibt es nicht. Ich empfehle Unternehmen Ihre Ausgangslage zu analysieren, erste Schritte zu definieren und loszulegen. Mein Motto lautet: Starten statt Warten!",

    "title": "Key questions CISOs must ask before adopting AI-enabled cyber solutions",
    "summary": "Adversaries are hijacking AI technology for their own purposes, generating deepfakes , creating clever phishing lures , and launching novel types of advanced attacks. They are also targeting AI systems with prompt injection attacks aimed at tricking models into revealing sensitive data. And users are leaking sensitive data through the unauthorized or careless use of AI. CISOs who don’t respond to these threats with their own AI-powered defenses are putting their organizations at risk. According to IBM’s 2025 Cost of a Data Breach report, based on a survey by the Ponemon Institute, organizations that extensively deployed AI across their enterprise cybersecurity defenses slashed the amount of time it took to recover from a breach by 80 days, lowering their average breach cost by $1.9 million . And 20% of organizations surveyed said they suffered a breach due to security incidents involving shadow AI. The additional breach cost associated with high levels of shadow AI was an estimated $670,000, according to the report. Virtually every established security vendor and scores of startups are touting AI-powered security solutions. Incumbents are embedding AI into their existing toolsets. And startups are offering autonomous agents that address specific areas such as vulnerability assessments, email security, endpoint security, or cloud data security. IDC analyst Craig Robinson says, “Vendors are rapidly embedding AI and generative AI into their incident response workflows to enhance speed, accuracy, and scalability.” Key applications include threat detection, triage, and anomaly detection; generative AI for automated report generation, timeline reconstruction, and executive summaries; natural language queries for log analysis and threat hunting; and AI agents for malware analysis, code interpretation, and adversary behavior prediction. A survey of CISOs conducted by Splunk reveals that the top use cases for AI and gen AI security are threat detection, triaging alerts, querying security data, automating alert management and response, threat hunting, suggesting investigation steps, threat analysis, and processing phishing emails. Novel uses of AI for defense are rapidly evolving, including machine-learning generative adversarial networks. And agentic AI use cases for cybersecurity are already on the horizon. For CISOs looking to enhance their security defenses with AI-powered tools, here are some key questions to ask prospective AI security vendors. But before CISOs engage with vendors, it’s important to get your ducks in a row. What CISOs need to think about before talking to vendors How does the use of AI at my organization expand our attack surface? It’s important to get a clear picture of how current and future AI implementations at your organization create new potential vulnerabilities. Achieving that clarity will require asking a wide range of questions that span the organization and beyond. For example, are we deploying or planning to deploy clusters of GPU-based servers in the data center to run AI workloads? Will my current network detection and response tools be able to handle this surge in additional traffic? Are software developers writing new AI apps? How do I protect that development pipeline? How is AI being embedded in my organization’s supply chain? Are we currently building or planning to build our own LLMs on premises, in the cloud, or will we be using third-party LLMs? Everyday SaaS productivity tools incorporate AI into workflows; how do I protect that back-and-forth traffic, which might contain sensitive information? According to the IBM-Ponemon breach report, 13% of surveyed organizations have experienced an attack on their AI models or applications. “That percentage is small, for now. We are likely to see many more in the coming 12 months, unless security leaders and their business counterparts recognize the risk and pivot to focus more intently on AI security,” says the report. What is my risk tolerance, level of maturity, and regulatory environment? There’s no point in buying an agentic tool that the vendor claims to be capable of acting autonomously, if the culture of your shop is that these types of tools won’t be completely trusted or properly deployed. Your security practitioners might not get full value out of them or might not use them at all. If your organization is in a highly regulated industry, will it pass muster with the auditors if your logs and other telemetry data are sent to the cloud for processing? What problem am I trying to solve ? Before jumping into an AI security solution, CISOs need to clearly identify the highest priority risks. Are you worried about data leakage, ransomware, incident response, data privacy regulations, securing the application development pipeline, securing assets in the cloud? Or all the above? It’s important to align your most critical needs with the strengths of the vendor solution. Platform or point product? The perennial point product vs. platform conundrum applies to AI security as well. If my organization has an incumbent security platform vendor and is satisfied with that vendor, does the incumbent offer sufficient AI security capabilities to meet my needs, currently and in the future? Or do I need to seek out point products to address specific gaps? Questions to ask vendors about their AI security offerings There are several areas where CISOs will want to focus their attention when considering AI-powered cyber solutions, including the following: Shadow AI: Uncovering and addressing shadow AI throughout the organization is a key issue for security leaders today. But so too is ensuring that sanctioned AI-enabled solutions are not misused in similar ways.To protect against this, CISOs should ask: Does the vendor offer discovery capabilities to help identify shadow AI usage? What policies and procedures, education and training, identity management and access control, data leakage protection, does the vendor offer to enable employees to continue to use AI, while layering on security features? Data protection: The superpower of AI security tools is their ability to ingest and process vast amounts of data in near real-time. But where does that data reside? On-prem, in the cloud, or both? Who is responsible for protecting LLMs and other data stores both at rest and in motion? If the vendor is using homegrown or third-party AI models, and providing conduits to the customer’s third-party AI models, how does the vendor protect those pipelines? How does the security team detect vulnerabilities or data leakage in a “black box” LLM? Who is responsible for protecting LLMs against prompt injection attacks or other types of model manipulation? Will my data be used to train the vendor’s models and, if so, how can I be sure that data is protected? Metrics: Much of the initial hype surrounding AI has turned to disappointment because organizations are struggling to identify benefits from AI pilot projects . CISOs need to be able to provide measurable results for any AI security tool. That can include improved mean-time-to-discovery (MMTD) and mean-time-to-recovery (MTTR) in the event of a breach, a quantifiable reduction in the rate of false positives, improved productivity among SOC staffers, increased accuracy of anomaly detection and threat hunting activities. CISOs should ask vendors and advisors, What metrics will best reflect the value these AI capabilities will have, and can those be captured to help assess the efficacy of the AI capabilities and our use of them? Workforce: What kind of training does the vendor provide for the most efficient use of AI, generative AI, and most importantly, agentic AI. Will the AI tool be able to automate low-level tasks so that my SOC analysts can focus on higher-level activities? How does the vendor offering help me to address the skills gap? Are there models and best practices for reorganizing my workforce for the era of AI. Will the use of AI security tools help address overwork and burnout among my staff? Are there specific guidelines or best practices for how my security team should interact with the AI in a human-in-the-loop, copilot-style scenario? Integration: How will the AI security tool integrate with my current security stack and my security processes and procedures? Most CISOs already have an overload of tools — EDR, XDR, SIEM, SOAR, CSPM, etc. What APIs and pre-built connections are provided to seamlessly integrate with my existing infrastructure? What types of agreements and alliances do you have with other vendors? How can I maintain a single dashboard? If a platform vendor has recently acquired an AI security tool, how well is that new capability integrated within the platform? Regulation: How will your tool conform to the specific regulatory requirements in my industry with regard to data storage and data privacy. Do you keep up with changes to regulations? Trust: How can I make sure that my security team trusts the decisions and recommendations that the AI systems make? In what ways can security practitioners go back and retrace how a model reached a conclusion? Scalability: It’s to be expected that data stores will increase in volume. And an enterprise might pilot the tool at one location, with plans to roll it out globally. How can I be sure the cloud-based AI tools can scale to meet my needs? Can the system handle large traffic volumes without performance delays. Does the solution encompass endpoints, networks, cloud, SaaS? Roadmap: What is your roadmap for updating the tool, delivering timely patches and providing new capabilities on a regular basis? Model integrity: How do you address concerns about bias in your models. How do you ensure data accuracy and integrity? How do you assure that the models are constantly updated to reflect changing real-world conditions. Vendor credibility : How long has this vendor been around? Do they have leaders with an industry pedigree? Do they have references that you can check? What is the financial viability of the company? For a startup, how much money have they raised? Are they generating revenue? Cost: What are the licensing terms? What types of SLAs or other performance metrics are included with a subscription?",

    "summary": "Hey everyone, listen I'm going to use AI to explain all this just a heads up but the deal is I patented a thesis and I was testing it out on Google's bug bounty program. I proved my work true. What happened I couldn't believe. Total systematical kernal failure! I found 15 vulnerabilities in 5 hours. I turned them into Google and demanded escalation. They closes every single one of them as frivolous. The thing is I have the patented solution for there failure.Any way I've been working on a deeply unstable process interaction that appears to leverage several non-atomic file operations within the Linux VFS (Virtual File System) layer. The initial finding focused on a classic Local Privilege Escalation (LPE) Race Condition, but further analysis revealed about 15 different patterns where similar non-atomic functions could be exploited under specific high-stress timing conditions. The core issue seems to stem from a fundamental architectural oversight where certain file security checks and subsequent critical operations (rename, chown, etc.) are not treated as a single, uninterruptible transaction (an atomic operation). My Situation & Mitigation I have developed a full Proof-of-Concept (PoC) for the most critical LPE. I have implemented an aggressive, real-time countermeasure (a Time Slice Watchdog) on my own systems to detect and block the exploitation attempt based on abnormal CPU time usage during the race window. This mitigation is currently running successfully. I have detailed technical documentation explaining the root cause, the affected functions, and the required kernel-level mitigation (using atomic primitives).

I interviewed for a SOC Analyst role at a well-known company in early November. I cleared all stages, scored very high, and HR told me I was in their top 3 candidates. They were waiting only for the client to approve the project start date before sending offers. Last week, HR sent an email to all shortlisted candidates saying: They “don’t have positive news on the start date right now” The client is delaying due to year-end activities and budget finalizations There will be an “additional delay” They’ll update us once they receive further communication So basically the project is on hold until budgets reopen. This isn’t a rejection — just a freeze — but I’m unsure how much hope I should realistically keep. Have any of you been in a similar situation? Do client-based roles often restart in January, or should I mentally move on? Would appreciate any insight, especially from people who’ve worked in SOC or consulting environments.

    "title": "$80k Analyst role - no certifications and unrelated degree",
    "summary": "Hello everyone. In a field where it seems like every opening requires 4+ years of experience, and it takes 1000 applications to get 1 response, I wanted to share my experience with getting a role fresh out of university. As the title says, I signed my offer for $80k (with benefits and 401k matching and all that) my senior year of university with no certifications, and a frankly unrelated degree. My degree is in Computer Criminology / Cyber criminology through the college of criminology. I had no certifications, although I did put “Security+ - in progress” on my resume. I did have the Google Cyber Cert. I had a Github with a couple projects on there, but very limited in scope. Anyone dedicated to making projects for 3-4 months could easily surpass what I had. I did have a significant amount work experience when applying, which may make this write up a little misleading. However, as you will see later, I was offered other opportunities prior to majority of my work experience. My first internship was a data science role for a local company in my city. My neighbor (who happened to be an alumni of my university), was friends with some of the HR people, and gave me their contact to reach out. I will say, it seemed that my social skills were more important than my technical skills. I connected with the HR manager over cars, and we traded stories about some of the more complicated repairs we had to make recently. He asked about my technical skills and I described what I learned from my Google cyber cert, and the things I’ve learned from my applicable classes (couple of C++ and UNIX classes). He seemed to approve, and offered me my choice of roles. An app dev role or a “data security” role. I’m not a fan of programming, so I took the data security one. Day 1 I was completely lost. I was working on a project for a company doing FinTech stuff. I was refactoring Python code for data pipelines and this OCR project to analyze images. I also wrote a boatload of documentation using pdoc, Sphinx, and good old Microsoft Word. I didn’t know much about Python, and I didn’t know ANYTHING about data science. So I would spend the whole day learning what I could, then going home and learning some more. Even though this was a part time role, 20hrs a week, I must’ve put in 50+ hours every week just trying to catch up to a level where I would feel adequately competent to actually do the work. By the end of it (2 months), I hadn’t really accomplished a whole lot, but I had refactored some of the regex to make the OCR a bit more efficient, and I wrote a bunch of documentation for anybody else who might be brought onto the project. Again, social skills came into play, as every week I would have a meeting with the HR manager who hired me, and my project manager from the FinTech company. At the end of it, the HR guy invited me to go golfing with the guys at some point, and the project manager came down to the officer (he worked remotely from a different state) to meet me in person. Overall, very successful summer. Now the next year, my junior year summer, I thought all hope was lost. I had applied to ~800ish internships, had 7 interviews, all of which I made it to the last round, but was offered precisely zero opportunities. I had reached out to the same company mentioned above to see if they had any open positions months prior, but didn’t hear anything back. Eventually, I was offered a position to be a full time intern working in a SOC for a power company in a different state. Quick interlude - I was out of positions to apply to in my state after the first 300 or so, so eventually I started applying all over the nation, looking for anything I could get. Social skills, again, would be what I’d put money on if asked what got me the job. I connected with the main security engineer over the football team of my University, and cracked some jokes about the fake Zoom backgrounds of the others in the call. Just before I accepted that offer (3 months, 40hrs a week, $25.50 an hour), the company I did my previous internship with reached out to me saying they had a full-time offer for me, working on the same project under the same project manager. I found out later the project manager asked for me by name because he thought I did good work and had a good personality that would mesh with the rest of the team. $50k a year on contract, not as an employee so no benefits or anything, 40hrs a week. And yes this was while I still had 1 more year of school to go. Of course I had to take the offer, but I explained to them my hours might be a little… disjointed due to my classes. They said no problem, just get your hours done on your free days or on the weekend. This went on for about 8months until I applied for my current Security Analyst role which I am at now. While I know it looks disheartening that I needed to have almost a full year of work experience before graduating university just to land an entry-level role, the power company internship had an 80% on return offers for the interns, meaning if I had taken that position, I likely would be working there right now instead. That means I would’ve cheesed my way into 1 internship by asking my neighbor, and that would’ve landed me my 2nd internship, which would’ve led me to a full time role. My thoughts: A degree is not needed to learn cyber security concepts, mine had very few cyber security applicable concepts. However, I DO think it is needed to get hired. Certifications are still asked for on every application I see, but very rarely do I hear them asked about in interviews. Seems to me this is more of a checkbox thing. It really is “who you know”, as much as I didn’t want it to be true. Social skills are arguably more important than the technical skills. Doesn’t mean you can be a total beginner, but they’d rather hire someone with an agreeable personality and good mindset over cyber Rainman. This was actually brought up in a number of my interviews. Many of the hiring managers complemented my interview ability, and how they appreciated how I was able to get my points across professionally and concisely. These jobs had hundreds of applicants, so I’m sure some of them were technical geniuses. But them complimenting my conversational skills means I was a standout candidate when it came to my social abilities. Interestingly, AI/LLMs haven’t been particularly relevant in my interviews. I use it all the time to generate scripts or for troubleshooting but not once was I asked about it. While I am absolutely a baby in this field, I’d like to think I have a better perspective on the state of the industry when it comes to job opportunities as I just recently had to go through this application grind that so many of us fear.

I’ve been offered a role at a small Fintech, it’s a generalist role so doing everything from Vulnerability Management to GRC. Salaries are the same, but at the Fintech I am offered shares. Other benefits are similar and this isn’t important for me at my career stage anyway. Prior to my SOC role. I worked mainly in GRC, I switched to SOC so I could improve my technical skills and this is still important for me. I have aprox 4 years IT experience (1 year service desk, 2 years GRC, 1 year SOC). My main priority at the moment is improving my technical knowledge. I feel SOC has been great for that, and I’m wondering if it would be stupid to move to a generalist role at a FinTech so soon? Will I still be able to gain the technical knowledge I desire?

    "summary": "I’ve been noticing a trend with ransomware insurance. It usually comes with a higher premium, and when an attack happens, the payout is often made quickly — which, unintentionally, ends up benefiting the attackers. Cyber insurance is meant to help organizations recover from the financial impact of a cyber incident, but with ransomware specifically, it feels like we’re actually fueling a whole “ransomware business model.” Attackers now seem to know exactly how much money to expect and how fast they’ll get it because insurers typically settle quickly. So here’s the question: Should we consider banning ransomware-related insurance coverage altogether to discourage attackers? UK has already taken steps toward banning ransom payments. Maybe that’s the kind of strong action needed to break this cycle submitted by /u/Overall_Reward963 [link] [comments]",

    "title": "Key findings from product telemetry: top storage security alerts across industries",
    "summary": "1.0 Introduction Cloud storage stands at the core of AI-driven applications, making its security more vital than ever. As generative AI continues to drive innovation, protecting the storage infrastructure becomes central to ensuring both the reliability and safety of AI solutions. Every industry encounters its own set of storage security challenges. For example, financial services must navigate complex compliance requirements and guard against insider risks. Healthcare organizations deal with the protection of confidential patient information (e.g. electronic medical records), while manufacturing and retail face the complexities of distributed environments and vulnerable supply chains. At Microsoft, we leverage product telemetry to gain insight into the most frequent storage security alerts and understand how risks manifest differently across various customer sectors. This article delves into how storage threats are shaped by industry dynamics, drawn on data collected from our customer base to illustrate emerging patterns and risks. Acknowledgement: This blog represents the collaborative work of the following Stroage security in MDC v-team members: Fernanda Vela and Alex Steele, for initiating the project and preparing the initial draft and directing the way we tell the story Eitan Bremler and Lior Tsalovich, for product and customer insights, synthesizing product telemetry and providing review Yuri Diogenes, for his supervision, review and cheerleading We extend our sincere appreciation to each contributor for their dedication and expertise. 1.1 Key findings from product telemetry: Top storage security alerts across industries Based on telemetry gathered from Microsoft Defender for Cloud, certain alerts consistently emerge as the most prevalent across different sectors. These patterns highlight the types of threats and suspicious activities organizations encounter most frequently, reflecting both industry-specific risks and broader attack trends. In the section that follows, this information is presented in detail, offering a breakdown of the most common alerts observed within each industry and providing valuable insight into how storage environments are being targeted and defended. 1.1.1 How does storage security alert in Defender for Cloud work To protect storage accounts from threats, Microsoft Defender for Cloud storage security provides a wide range of security alerts designed to detect suspicious, risky, or anomalous activity across Azure Storage services such as Blob Storage, Data Lake Gen2, and Azure Files. These alerts cover scenarios like unauthorized access attempts, abnormal usage patterns, potential data exfiltration, malware uploads or downloads, sensitive data exposure and changes that may expose storage containers to the public. They leverage threat intelligence and behavioral analytics to identify activity from malicious IPs, unusual geographies, or suspicious applications, ensuring organizations are alerted when their storage environment is potentially at risk. Each alert is categorized by severity, helping organizations prioritize responses to the most critical threats, such as confirmed malware or credential compromise, while also surfacing medium and low-risk anomalies that may indicate early stages of an attack. Overall, Defender for Storage enables proactive monitoring and rapid detection of threats to cloud storage, reducing the risk of exposure, misuse, or compromise of valuable data assets. 1.1.2 Top alert types for major industries Financial, healthcare, technology, energy and manufacturing are often cited as the most targeted industries because of the value of their data, regulatory exposure and their role in critical infrastructure. Our telemetry from Microsoft Defender for Cloud (MDC) shows the top security alerts in storage resources across these five industries: Finance industry Health care industry Manufacturing industry Software industry Energy industry 1.1.3 Top 9 alerts across industries Across industries, the most common alert—averaging 1,300 occurrences per month—is “Unusual application accessed a storage account,” indicating unexpected access to a storage account. Below are the top cross-industry alerts based on this analysis. 1.2 Analysis Application Anomaly Alerts Ranking: #1 across all industries (Finance, Manufacturing, Software, Energy, Healthcare) Alert: Access from a suspicious application (Storage.Blob_ApplicationAnomaly) Why it happens: Organizations increasingly use automation, third-party integrations, and custom scripts to interact with cloud storage. Shadow IT and lack of centralized app governance lead to unexpected access patterns. In sectors like healthcare and finance, sensitive data attracts attackers who may use compromised or malicious apps to probe for weaknesses. Interpretation: High prevalence indicates a need for stricter application registration, monitoring, and access controls. Industries should prioritize visibility into which apps are accessing storage and enforce policies to block unapproved applications. Geo-Anomaly Alerts Ranking: #2 or #3 in most industries Alert: Access from an unusual location (Storage.Blob_GeoAnomaly, Storage.Files_GeoAnomaly) Why it happens: Global operations, remote work, and distributed teams are common in energy, manufacturing, and healthcare. Attackers may use VPNs or compromised credentials to access storage from unusual regions. Interpretation: Frequent geo-anomalies suggest gaps in geo-fencing and conditional access policies. Organizations should review access logs, enforce region-based restrictions, and monitor cross-border data flows. Malware-Related Alerts Ranking: Prominent in healthcare, finance, and software sectors Alert: Malware found in blob (Storage.Blob_AM.MalwareFound) Malware download detected (Storage.Blob_MalwareDownload) Access from IP with suspicious file hash reputation (Storage.Blob_MalwareHashReputation) Why it happens: High-value data and frequent file exchanges make these industries attractive targets for ransomware and malware campaigns. Insufficient scanning capacity or delayed remediation can allow malware to persist. Interpretation: Rising malware alerts point to active threat campaigns and the need for real-time scanning and automated remediation. Industries should scale up Defender capacity, integrate threat intelligence, and enable automatic malware removal. Open Container Scanning Alerts Ranking: More frequent in energy and manufacturing Alerts: Successful discovery of open storage containers (Storage.Blob_OpenContainersScanning.SuccessfulDiscovery) Failed attempt to scan open containers (Storage.Blob_OpenContainersScanning.FailedAttempt) Why it happens: Rapid cloud adoption and operational urgency can lead to misconfigured storage containers. Legacy systems and lack of automated policy enforcement increase exposure risk. Interpretation: High rates of open container alerts signal the need for regular configuration audits and automated security policies. Organizations should prioritize closing public access and monitoring for changes in container exposure. Anonymous Access & Data Exfiltration Alerts Ranking: Present across industries, especially where sensitive data is stored Alerts: Anonymous access anomaly detected (Storage.Blob_AnonymousAccessAnomaly) Data exfiltration detected: unusual amount/number of blobs (Storage.Blob_DataExfiltration.AmountOfDataAnomaly, Storage.Blob_DataExfiltration.NumberOfBlobsAnomaly) Why it happens: Attackers may attempt to access data anonymously or exfiltrate large volumes of data. Weak access controls or lack of monitoring can enable these behaviors. Interpretation: These alerts should trigger immediate investigation and remediation. Organizations must enforce strict access controls and monitor for abnormal data movement. Key Takeaways Across Industries Application anomaly and geo-anomaly alerts are universal, reflecting the challenges of managing automation and global access in modern cloud environments. Malware-related alerts are especially critical in sectors handling sensitive or regulated data, indicating active targeting by threat actors. Open container and capacity alerts reveal operational and configuration risks, often tied to rapid scaling and cloud adoption. Interpreting these trends: High alert shares for specific patterns should drive targeted investments in security controls, monitoring, and automation. Industries must adapt their security strategies to their unique risk profiles, balancing innovation with robust protection. 1.3 Protect storage accounts from threats To address these challenges, Microsoft Defender for Cloud Storage Security offers: Real-time monitoring of storage-related threats: Identifies unusual access patterns with direct integration with Azure. Detect and mitigate with threat intelligence: understand threat context and reduce false positives. Integration with Defender XDR: Provides unified threat correlation, investigation and triaging with industry leading SIEM integration. 2.0 Malware in Storage: A Growing Threat Based on the findings from section 1, let’s analyze which industry receives the most amount of malware related threats: 2.1 Top Findings Healthcare: Malware found in blob (8.6%) Malware download detected (5.5%) Malware hash reputation (4.6%) Total malware-related share: ~18.7% Finance: Malware found in blob (4.5%) Malware download detected (3.9%) Malware hash reputation (4.6%) Total malware-related share: ~13% Manufacturing: Malware found in blob (8.5%) Malware download detected (2.7%) Malware hash reputation (3.3%) Total malware-related share: ~14.5% Software: Malware found in blob (7.8%) Malware download detected (5.9%) Malware hash reputation (15.6%) Total malware-related share: ~29.3% (notably high due to hash reputation alert) Energy: Malware hash reputation (4.2%) Malware found in blob (not top 7) Malware download detected (not top 7) Total malware-related share: ~4.2% (lower than other sectors) 2.2 Analysis Software industry has the highest ranked malware alerts, especially due to a very high share for “Malware hash reputation” (15.6%) and significant shares for “Malware found in blob” and “Malware download detected.” Healthcare also has a high combined share of malware alerts, but not as high as software. Finance, Manufacturing, and Energy have lower shares for malware alerts compared to software and healthcare. How to Read This Trend Software companies are likely targeted more for malware due to their high volume of code, frequent file exchanges, and integration with many external sources. Healthcare is also a prime target because of sensitive patient data (e.g. electronic medical records) and regulatory requirements. If your organization is in software or healthcare, pay extra attention to malware scanning, automated remediation, and threat intelligence integration. Regularly review and update malware protection policies. 2.3 How Microsoft Helps Prevent Malware Spread Defender for Cloud mitigates these risks by: Scanning for malicious content on upload or on demand, in storage accounts Automatic remediation after suspicious uploads Integrating with threat intelligence for threat context correlation, advance investigation and threat response.

    "title": "What are zero-day attacks and why do they work?",
    "summary": "Zero-day attacks have become a significant concern in the realm of cybersecurity, posing a formidable challenge to individuals and organizations alike. These attacks exploit vulnerabilities that are unknown to the software vendor, leaving systems exposed to potential breaches. As cyberthreats evolve, understanding zero-day attacks and implementing effective protection strategies is crucial for maintaining security. Understanding zero-day attacks What is a zero-day vulnerability, exploit, and attack? A zero-day vulnerability refers to a software security flaw that is unknown to the vendor. When attackers exploit this vulnerability, it becomes a zero-day exploit. A zero-day attack occurs when malicious actors use this exploit to compromise a system before a patch is available. Why “zero-day”? The term “zero-day” signifies that the vendor has zero days to address the vulnerability before it is exploited. This urgency highlights the critical nature of these threats because they can be leveraged by attackers immediately upon discovery. Common targets of zero-day attacks Zero-day attacks often target operating systems, web browsers, enterprise software, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. These platforms are integral to daily operations, making them attractive targets for attackers seeking to maximize impact. Why zero-day attacks are so effective Zero-day attacks have several advantages in the cybersecurity landscape. Due to their novel nature, they can be challenging to detect and understand. Here are some common reasons they work when deployed against unsuspecting targets: No available patch: These exploits are unknown to both vendors and defenders, meaning they have not been identified and patched yet, leaving the door open for attackers. High-value targets: These attacks are often used in cyber espionage, ransomware campaigns, and advanced persistent threats (APTs) to target high-value assets with sensitive data. Difficult to detect: These exploits often are missed by traditional detection tools, especially those relying on signature-based detection, allowing adversaries to operate undetected. Speed and stealth: Successful breaches are more likely with zero-day attacks because attackers act quickly and quietly, allowing them to exploit vulnerabilities before they are identified and patched. Precision targeting: The target of these exploits is often a specific individual or organization. Spear-phishing and zero-click attacks are common tactics used to initiate the breach. Real-world zero-day attack examples No organization is immune to being targeted by a zero-day attack. In the real world, many key services, organizations, and platforms can be targeted by zero-day exploits: Nation-state sabotage: State-sponsored attackers can target critical infrastructure and utilities with zero-day exploits, rendering key services and life-saving utilities unavailable. Mobile surveillance: In telecommunications, carriers have witnessed zero-click exploits being used in mobile surveillance. This leads to compromised devices without any user interaction. Supply chain attacks: Global supply chains are appealing targets because they have a wide impact. In exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities, attackers can impact several groups in one attack, such as consumers, manufacturers, employees, and more. Frequently targeted platforms: Web browsers and email servers are common targets of zero-day attacks. These are widely used, increasing the potential for significant disruption. How zero-day vulnerabilities are discovered and used There are multiple groups and methodologies that work to discover, use, and inform organizations of zero-day vulnerabilities. These include: White-hat researchers: Often ethical hackers, also known as white-hat researchers, discover zero-day vulnerabilities via bug bounty programs and responsible disclosure. This helps vendors identify and address these issues. Black-hat hackers: On the flip side, if a black-hat hacker identifies a vulnerability before it is patched, the hacker can leverage it for gain, often selling exploits on the dark web. Government agencies: Some government agencies engage in offensive cyber operations, stockpiling exploits for strategic purposes. They also can inform organizations and vendors of these exploits, much like white-hat researchers. Thorough investigation: Internal security teams can leverage investigation capabilities, such as packet-level insights, to discover and understand zero-day threats, preventing future occurrences. How to defend against zero-day attacks There are several measures security and network teams can take to more effectively avoid zero-day attacks. Some examples include: Leverage threat investigation: Detection alone often misses the unknown. Thorough investigation, leveraging deep packet inspection (DPI) at scale and forensic analysis, is key to identifying and preventing zero-day attacks from being successful now and in the future. Patch quickly: Prioritizing updates and effective vulnerability management is essential to mitigating the risk of zero-day attacks. Use behavior-based detection: Employing solutions such as endpoint detection and response (EDR), network detection and response (NDR) , and extended detection and response (XDR) in combination with a strong investigation focus can help identify anomalous behavior that can signify zero-day exploits are being leveraged. Adopt zero-trust principles: Implementing a zero-trust security architecture , limiting user access, and continuously verifying identities can reduce the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive data. Segment the network: Strategic network segmentation helps contain breaches and minimizes lateral movement within a compromised system. Stay informed: Subscribing to security advisories and threat intelligence feeds helps keep organizations informed on emerging threats and vulnerabilities. FAQs about zero-day attacks What makes zero-day attacks different from other cyberthreats? Zero-day attacks exploit unknown vulnerabilities, making them particularly challenging to defend against compared with threats targeting known vulnerabilities. Can antivirus software detect zero-day exploits? Traditional antivirus software may struggle to detect zero-day exploits due to its reliance on signature-based detection methods. Are zero-day vulnerabilities illegal to sell or use? Although selling or using zero-day vulnerabilities for malicious purposes is illegal, ethical disclosure through bug bounty programs is encouraged. How long do zero-day exploits typically remain undetected? The duration for which a zero-day exploit remains undetected varies, but it can range from days to months, depending on the complexity of the exploit and the vigilance of security teams. Staying ahead of emerging threats with investigation Zero-day attacks represent a significant threat in the cybersecurity landscape, exploiting unknown vulnerabilities to devastating effect. Understanding these attacks and implementing proactive defensive strategies is essential for staying ahead of emerging threats. Detection alone is not enough. Detection-focused tools such as EDR, NDR, and XDR on their own miss the unknown, allowing zero-day attacks to have a better chance of success. Leveraging investigation, powered by packet data, empowers teams with the actionable data to detect, understand, and prevent future attacks. Packets do not lie, and the network is the only place adversaries cannot hide. Learn more about Omnis Cyber Intelligence .",

    "title": "The first line of defense is still the network. But that’s only the beginning",
    "summary": "For years, the security industry has been captivated by the promises of new acronyms: EDR, XDR, CDR. Each wave has promised broader coverage, better detection, and faster responses. And although each of these tools provides value, recent research from Enterprise Strategy Group (ESG) reveals something the industry conversation often overlooks: When real threats emerge, organizations still turn first to the network. According to ESG , 53% of organizations rely on network visibility and telemetry as their primary line of defense. In fact, nearly two-thirds use the network in some capacity to kick off their threat detection and response processes. Even more telling, 93% of SecOps and NetOps teams now share the same network visibility tools, which is a sign that the network has become the unifying language of operations. So, why in an era dominated by extended detection and response (XDR) and cloud-native tooling does the network remain the first place security teams look? The answer is simple: Packets don’t lie. Why packets still matter Endpoints can be tampered with. Logs can be incomplete. Cloud providers can limit visibility. But network packets capture every transaction, every communication, and every anomaly, without bias. This is why, despite some vendors dismissing network detection and response (NDR) as “old-school” or “on-premises,” ESG found that 41% of organizations actually see network tools as the best-equipped technology for providing visibility across hybrid, multicloud environments. The truth is that the network has evolved right alongside the environments it protects. It’s no longer just about physical appliances watching traffic at the perimeter. Today’s NDR solutions scale across data centers, virtual servers, and multicloud ecosystems, providing a single vantage point where everything converges. Detection is only step one But here’s where we believe the conversation needs to change. Detection, while critical, is just the first step. The real challenge, and the real value, lies in understanding a threat through the investigation phase. Think about it: an alert tells you something happened. But only investigation tells you what it was, how it happened, and what to do about it. That’s the gap where attackers thrive and where security operations center (SOC) teams often lose valuable time. And this is where network visibility proves its worth beyond being just a “first line of defense.” With full packet capture and deep network intelligence, security teams can pivot from “we detected something” to “we understand everything about it.” That shift is the difference between chasing alerts and actually stopping adversaries in their tracks. Why NETSCOUT Omnis Cyber Intelligence At NETSCOUT, we’ve seen this shift firsthand. Omnis Cyber Intelligence isn’t just about spotting anomalies; it’s about giving analysts the complete, packet-level context they need to investigate confidently. By unifying SecOps and NetOps on a shared foundation of visibility, Omnis Cyber Intelligence helps eliminate blind spots that attackers exploit. Because at the end of the day, detection will always be table stakes. Investigation is where the real impact is made. Network packets provide the single source of truth across on-premises, hybrid, and cloud environments, serving as the foundation that makes it all possible. Learn more about the ESG report .

    "title": "Gain Cross-Cloud Network traffic insights with VPC Flow Logs and Flow Analyzer",
    "summary": "Gaining visibility into your network traffic is crucial, particularly with hybrid environments encompassing both on-premises and cross-cloud infrastructure. VPC Flow Logs have long been a staple to obtain detailed records of network traffic to, from, and within your Google Cloud subnets. But with the rise of more complex network topologies enabled by the Cross-Cloud Network , we knew we needed to expand VPC Flow Logs to give you a more complete picture. That's why we're excited to share that you can now enable VPC Flow Logs directly on your Cloud VPN tunnels and VLAN attachments for Cloud Interconnect and Cross-Cloud Interconnect. This enhancement provides comprehensive monitoring of critical network traffic moving between your on-prem infrastructure, cross-cloud resources, and Google Cloud. With this new capability, you can: Gain granular insights: Log network flows passing through Cloud Interconnect and Cloud VPN with 5-tuple granularity (source/destination IP, source/destination port, protocol). Optimize performance: Quickly identify \"elephant flows\" (high-bandwidth flows) that might be congesting a specific VPN tunnel or VLAN attachment, enabling you to better plan and manage capacity. Audit Shared VPC usage: In Shared VPC environments, identify which service projects are consuming the most hybrid bandwidth. Map utilization to flows: Understand exactly how your hybrid connections are being utilized by mapping high-level bandwidth graphs to specific application flows. Diagnose connectivity issues: When an on-prem/cross-cloud application can't reach a Google Cloud resource, use logs to check if the traffic is arriving at the Google Cloud gateway (VLAN attachment or VPN tunnel). Finetune your application awareness on Cloud Interconnect policy configurations: Monitor and verify that your applications are marking differentiated services field codepoints (DSCP) correctly. To provide more context to these flows, we've also added \" gateway \" annotations to VPC Flow Logs. Think of a gateway as the entry or exit point for traffic traveling between your Google Cloud VPC and an external network. When you inspect a flow log of Cross-Cloud Network traffic, you'll now see two key new fields : reporter : This field tells you the direction of the traffic, relative to the gateway. SRC_GATEWAY : The traffic was observed entering Google Cloud through Cloud Interconnect or Cloud VPN (e.g., on-prem to Google Cloud). DEST_GATEWAY : The traffic was observed exiting Google Cloud through Cloud Interconnect or Cloud VPN (e.g., Google Cloud to on-prem). gateway object : This JSON payload provides the full context of the gateway itself, including its name , type (VPN_TUNNEL or INTERCONNECT_ATTACHMENT), project_id , and location . Analyze your logs with Flow Analyzer To help you analyze your flow logs without writing-complex SQL queries, we’ve also integrated the new gateway annotations directly into Flow Analyzer , a native tool for performing deep network traffic analysis on your VPC Flow Logs stored in Cloud Logging at no additional cost. Using Flow Analyzer, you can: Quickly identify top talkers in your network with 5-tuple granularity.

    "title": "Microsoft gives Windows admins a legacy migration headache with WINS sunset",
    "summary": "Microsoft has given system administrators until 2034 to stop using WINS (Windows Internet Name Service) NetBIOS name resolution technology in their networks — but even nine years may not be enough notice for some: WINS is very much still in use, supporting a niche range of difficult-to-replace legacy systems. WINS dates from Windows NT in 1994 and has long since been displaced by the more modern Domain Name System (DNS). It was deprecated in 2021 to coincide with the appearance of Windows Server 2022. This meant it would be supported but no longer developed, a clear signal that the clock was ticking. Now, Microsoft has said, the last operating system to support WINS will be Windows Server 2025. That’s what determines the nine-year final migration deadline — the lifespan of Windows Server 2025 on the Long-Term Servicing Channel (LTSC). “Organizations using WINS are strongly encouraged to migrate to modern DNS-based name resolution solutions,” the company said, perhaps stating the obvious, in a Windows Message Center advisory in early November. According to Microsoft, the timescale is generous. “Our goal is to make planning and migrations as predictable and low-stress as possible. With advanced notice and a support runway, organizations can confidently modernize their environments at their own pace,” it said. Cutting out WINS Future versions of Windows without support for WINS will lose the WINS Server role and associated binaries, the WINS Microsoft Management Console (MMC) snap-in, and WINS automation APIs and related management interfaces, the company added. WINS migration is yet another legacy issue inherited from the creative ferment of computer networking in the 1980s and 1990s. That era needed solutions to lots of networking problems in a hurry, especially how to turn a desktop PC operating system such as DOS or Windows into a practical server platform. WINS solved an important challenge: how to connect the names used to identify computers using the 1980s’ NetBIOS network naming system with modern IP addresses. DNS, a hierarchical system that worked for Internet as well as network addresses, had rendered NetBIOS obsolete. But both ended up co-existing, examples of how the industry delivered more than one answer to the same problem. Today, the arguments for getting rid of WINS extend beyond its obsolescence. It is also a security risk. In 2017, Fortinet’s FortiGuard Labs discovered a WINS Server remote memory corruption vulnerability in Windows Server 2008, 2012, and 2016. Microsoft’s reply to Fortinet made interesting reading: “A fix would require a complete overhaul of the code to be considered comprehensive. The functionality provided by WINS was replaced by DNS and Microsoft has advised customers to migrate away from it.” In short, Microsoft had no plans to patch the issue. Its solution was that customers migrate away from WINS, a process it has since become clear could still be ongoing for some customers into the 2030s. Why WINS is still in use Organizations still using WINS are likely to fall into one of two categories: those using it to support old technologies with long lifecycles such as operational technology (OT) systems, and those that have simply half-forgotten that they are still using it. “For OT stacks built around WINS/NetBIOS, replacing them isn’t trivial because changing name resolution touches safety‑critical systems and bespoke integrations,” said Kieran Bhardwaj , head of security engineering at UK cyber security consultancy Bridewell, which specializes in advising on critical infrastructure. “Legacy technologies persist because some niche systems like industrial/OT environments are engineered for multi‑decade lifecycles. Many control systems are architecturally fixed and can’t be re‑platformed,” he said. “It’s also hard for Microsoft: WINS sits deep in the networking stack which means removing a once‑core component demands exhaustive regression to avoid unintended breakage.” Equally, according to William Wright of pen-testing company Closed Door Security, WINS was still running on some networks for the same reason that many legacy technologies overstay their usefulness: migration apathy. “Most organizations running WINS today probably aren’t actively using it for anything critical. They’ve just never had a compelling reason to turn it off,” he said. “It’s been quietly replicating in the background, consuming minimal resources, causing no obvious problems. That’s the nature of legacy infrastructure: It persists not because it’s needed, but because removing it requires effort and carries risk, while leaving it alone is free,” said Wright. WINS is a security risk WINS had major design limitations that made it a security risk, said Wright. “WINS has no mechanism to verify the legitimacy of name registrations, which makes it vulnerable to spoofing attacks,” said Wright. “An attacker on the network can register malicious entries, including Web Proxy Auto-Discovery (WPAD) records to intercept web traffic, or redirect connections to systems they control. It’s a straightforward path for lateral movement,” he said. Finding WINS still turned on inside a network was a godsend to hackers using open-source tools such as Responder to conduct name resolution poisoning attacks against legacy Windows protocols such as Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR) and the NetBIOS Name Service (NBT-NS), Wright added. Worse, the presence of WINS often indicated that a target was using other vulnerable legacy protocols. “Systems often fall back to NetBIOS broadcast queries when WINS isn’t available, which are spoofable on local networks. This is exactly what tools like Responder exploit, and it remains a common technique in penetration testing and real-world attacks alike.” Network inventory Organizations looking to rip WINS out should start with an inventory to find out where it is being used, Bhardwaj said: “Many organizations don’t realize a legacy asset still relies on WINS, so proactively inventory older segments and OT/ICS networks and verify resolution paths before the next upgrade window.” “The trade-off is that customers still using WINS must put in the work to move to DNS by auditing dependencies, modernizing or isolating legacy workloads, and implementing DNS. But the payoff is a simpler, more secure platform. In the end, even the brightest and best-performing technologies will one day be legacy. Migrating from WINS is a test of how well organizations are dealing with this wider problem. “There’s way too much legacy that is unused and that presents an attack surface for no reason,” said Bhardwaj.

The requirement is mainly to confirm the authenticity and relevance of my work — which is relatively straightforward given my public talks, articles, and industry contributions across North America. This is a big opportunity for me, and I’d be grateful for any guidance, introductions, or support from the Australian cybersecurity community.

    "summary": "Zu Weihnachten die Rechner der Verwandtschaft auf Botnet-Aktivitäten überprüfen – der kostenlose GreyNoise IP Check machts möglich. Jaiz Anuar – Shutterstock.com Hacks greifen immer stärker Unternehmen an, weil die Beute in Form von Lösegeld und Daten dort aussichtreicher ist als bei Privatpersonen. Das bedeutet jedoch nicht, dass eine Einzelperson kein lohnendes Opfer ist. Im Gegenteil – Computer von Individuen zu infizieren kann sich für Kriminelle auszahlen, insbesondere wenn sie Botnetze oder Residential-Proxy-Netzwerke einrichten. Doch wie kann man herausfinden, ob der eigene Rechner infiziert ist, selbst ohne Vorkenntnisse und Fachwissen? Ein kostenloses Tool GreyNoise IP Check von GreyNoise Labs hilft zu überprüfen, ob die eigene IP-Adresse bei schädlichen Scans erfasst wurde. Diese Vorsichtsmaßnahme begründen die Experten so: „Manchmal installieren Nutzer wissentlich Software, die solche Aktionen ausführt, und verdienen damit ein paar Euro. Häufiger jedoch schleicht sich Malware unbemerkt auf Geräte ein, meist über schädliche Apps oder Browsererweiterungen, und verwandelt diese im Hintergrund in Knotenpunkte in der Infrastruktur anderer.“ Analysieren und scannen Grundsätzlich gibt es diverse Möglichkeiten, um festzustellen, ob jemand Teil eines schädlichen Botnetzes geworden ist, nämlich, indem Geräteprotokolle, Konfigurationen, Netzwerkverkehr und Aktivitätsmuster analysiert werden. Ein Tool, das lediglich die IP-Adresse überprüft, sei aber die schonendste Methode, erklärt GreyNoise. Interessenten wird beim Besuch der IP-Check-Webseite, eines von drei möglichen Ergebnissen angezeigt: Der Rechner ist sauber, es wurden also keine schädlichen Scan-Aktivitäten festgestellt. Etwas Schädliches beziehungsweise Verdächtiges wurde gefunden, die IP-Adresse wurde beim Scannen des Internets erfasst oder ist in der GreyNoice-Datenbank verzeichnet. User sollten Geräte in ihrem Netzwerk überprüfen. Die IP-Adresse des Users gehört zu einem VPN, einem Unternehmensnetzwerk oder einem Cloud-Anbieter, und die Scan-Aktivität ist für diese Umgebungen normal. Korrelationen zwischen Installationen und Scans Wenn eine Aktivität mit der angegebenen IP-Adresse korreliert wird, zeigt die Plattform auch einen 90-tägigen Verlauf an. Das soll helfen, einen potenziellen Infektionsherd zu identifizieren und Abwehrmaßnahmen vornehmen. Bei einem positiven Befund wird eine Zeitleiste mit den Aktivitäten der letzten 90 Tage ausgegeben. GreyNoise JSON-Option für Fortgeschrittene Für technisch versierte Nutzer bietet GreyNoise außerdem eine nicht authentifizierte, rate-limit-free JSON-API. Diese ist über curl zugänglich und kann in Skripte oder Prüfsysteme integriert werden. Dies liefert strukturierte Daten zur fraglichen IP-Adresse, die in MDM-Systeme, VPN-Verbindungsskripte oder Netzwerk-Onboarding-Prozesse integriert werden können. Der Hersteller merkt an, dass Entwickler die Informationen in jeder beliebigen Programmiersprache verwenden können – solange ein curl-ähnlicher User-Agent vorhanden ist.",

    "title": "Contagious Interview attackers go ‘full stack’ to fool developers",
    "summary": "Researchers at Socket have uncovered more details of a sophisticated software supply-chain operation linked to the Contagious Interview campaign attacking developers who rely on packages from NPM. They report finding a “full stack” operation behind the attacks, where code hosting, package distribution, staging servers and command-and control (C2) infrastructure are orchestrated much like a legitimate software development and delivery pipeline — and offer honest developers fresh advice on protecting themselves against the attacks. In the latest wave, threat actors uploaded almost 200 new malicious NPM packages, with more than 31,000 recorded downloads. The campaign lures victims with fake job interviews and coding assignments related to Web3 and blockchain projects, asking them to pull dependencies for a “test project”. But the NPM packages they install are Trojan horses. The latest packages identified by Socket ultimately deliver a new payload with upgraded credential theft, system monitoring and remote access capabilities, enabling them to take over developers’ accounts and machines. Point defense Based on its latest analysis, Socket advised developers to focus on the weak points this campaign exploits, and to treat every “npm install” as potential remote code execution, restrict what continuous-integration runners can access, enforce network egress controls, and review the code of any new templates or utilities pulled from GitHub. Teams should also scrutinize unfamiliar helper packages, pin known-good versions, and use lockfiles instead of auto-updating dependencies, it advised. Automated package analysis can further reduce risk, with real-time scans catching threats including import-time loaders, network probing, and bulk data exfiltration before they hit developer machines or CI systems. With these checks in place, dependency onboarding and code review become effective filters for blocking Contagious Interview-style attacks early, Socket said. Coding tasks lead to malware delivery These defensive measures are effective because Contagious Interview’s entry vector relies heavily on social engineering, using fake interview tasks to trick developers into installing compromised dependencies. The campaign exploits NPM, a widely used package registry for JavaScript and Node.js, by publishing packages that appear benign but carry hidden payloads. The malicious packages including one named “tailwind-magic” mimic legitimate libraries (in this case, a typosquatted version of the genuine “tailwind-merge” utility) to avoid suspicion. When an unsuspecting developer installs such a package, a post-install script triggers and reaches out to a staging endpoint hosted on Vercel. That endpoint in turn delivers a live payload fetched from a threat-actor controlled GitHub account named “stardev0914”. From there the payload, a variant of OtterCookie that also folds in capabilities from the campaign’s other signature payload, BeaverTail , executes and establishes a remote connection to the attackers’ control server. The malware then silently harvests credentials, crypto-wallet data, browser profiles and more. “Tracing the malicious npm package tailwind-magic led us to a Vercel-hosted staging endpoint, tetrismic[.]vercel[.]app,and from there to the threat actor controlled GitHub account which contained 18 repositories,” Socket’s senior threat intelligence analyst Kirill Boychenko said in a blog post , crediting related research by Kieran Miyamoto that helped confirm the malicious GitHub account stardev0914. A ‘full stack’adversary: GitHub, Vercel, and NPM What makes this campaign stand out is the layered infrastructure behind it. Socket’s analysis traced not just the NPM packages but also how the attackers built a complete delivery pipeline: malware serving repositories on GitHub, staging servers on Vercel, and separate C2 servers for exfiltration and remote command execution. Through this setup, attackers can rotate payloads, update malware unobtrusively, and tailor deployments per target—all while blending deeply into the legitimate developer ecosystem, according to Boychenko. Once installed, OtterCookie doesn’t just run and vanish: It remains persistent, capable of logging keystrokes, hijacking the clipboard, scanning the filesystem, capturing screenshots, and grabbing browser and wallet credentials across Windows, macOS and Linux. The campaign actors’ intensified NPM activity arrives at a worrying moment for the JavaScript and open-source ecosystem. In recent months, the community has seen a flurry of NPM-based attacks — including worm-style campaigns that transformed popular packages into Trojan horses, automated credential theft , and widespread supply chain compromise across both development and CI environments.

    "title": "The CISO’s paradox: Enabling innovation while managing risk",
    "summary": "We can keep it real here. One of the main jobs CISOs have is to stop being the “Department of No.” We have to figure out how to enable the rapid delivery of products and services for the business without introducing risks to the same business. That’s the paradox in a nutshell. In an environment where product teams must constantly test new technologies and ship updates at record speed, traditional end-of-line audits wouldn’t keep up. Security has to move upstream. It must be built into everyday operations, with proactive, actionable measures that empower innovation instead of slowing it down. CISOs, then, must work more closely with teams from the initial stages to establish clear and practical risk tolerances and build security into development workflows. Partner early to shape outcomes CISOs don’t get leverage by showing up at the finish line. They must ditch the gatekeeper mindset and become true partners from Day Zero. In the past, when security measures were only brought in at the final stage, decision-makers were left with a difficult choice: accept project delays or face unmitigated risks. When product cycles were quarterly and speed did not determine competition, this approach made sense. In today’s reality with AI-driven product development, such a process breaks in an environment now made up of weekly sprints, continuous delivery and vendor-driven dependencies. When security understands revenue goals, customer promises and regulatory exposure, guidance becomes specific and enabling. Begin by embedding a security liaison with each product squad so there is always a known face to engage in identity, data flows, logging and encryption decisions as they form. We should not want to see engineers opening two-week tickets for a simple question. There should be open “office hours,” chat channels and quick calls so they can get immediate feedback on decisions like API design, encryption requirements and regional data moves. Bureaucracy must be deprecated in our environment. Show up at sprint planning and early design reviews to ask the questions that matter — authentication paths, least-privilege access, logging coverage and how changes will be monitored in production through SIEM and EDR. When security officers sit at the same table, the conversation changes from “Can we do this?” to “How do we do this securely?” and better outcomes follow from day one. Set risk tolerances and guardrails Teams slow down when they are unsure how to proceed. Take away some of the decision-making and ensure an integration of authentication, authorization and accounting into the development process. For authentication, establish and leverage enterprise identity management solutions rather than allowing the development of accounts written to databases that can be easily compromised. CISOs must also ensure they define standard role-based access control levels that ensure clear separation of duties is in place in the solution design. For accounting, don’t just create logs; ensure high-cardinality data is being captured for anomaly detection and this data is being integrated into a central security operations center for threat detection and response. Product development teams should not be tasked with security operations responsibilities; other teams should maintain the eye-on-glass visibility into the threats facing the solutions in production. CISOs must define the organization’s risk appetite in business language that removes ambiguity. Specify which third-party profiles require deep assessment and which can run as bounded pilots with compensating controls. State which vulnerability severities must block a merge and which can proceed with a time-bound remediation plan. Clarify what data classifications may cross regions and what protections must travel with them. Then translate those choices into automation. Bake guardrails into CI/CD and infrastructure-as-code so enforcement is consistent and visible. Scan each code commit for vulnerabilities, and if a change breaches a critical policy, the build fails with a clear reason and a path to resolution. If it sits within tolerance, it moves forward without manual intervention. The result is governance as an accelerator: predictable, transparent and aligned with how design engineers work. Build secure-by-design into fast developer lifecycles When developers deploy code multiple times a day, a “final security review” before launch just wouldn’t work. This traditional, end-of-line gating model doesn’t just block innovation but also fails to catch real-world risks. To be effective, security must be embedded during development, not just inspected after. If the secure path is harder than the insecure path, developers will choose the easy way every single time. Our job isn’t to hand out a 50-page PDF; it’s to bake security right into their developer environment, giving them pre-vetted, hardened templates that are secure by default. This means offering standard service templates with authentication and authorization already built in. When the secure component is easier to use than the insecure alternative, developers can adopt it easily and will adopt it every time. Automation is the enforcement layer for this strategy. When security tools are integrated directly into the CI/CD pipeline, feedback becomes available almost in real-time. This allows the team to “fail fast” on critical risks while providing actionable fixes. This discipline must further extend into production. Even with world-class DevSecOps, we know a zero-day or configuration drift can happen. That’s why we rely on over-arching web application shielding solutions that integrate a robust web application firewall with runtime application attack mitigation and self-protection. These solutions mitigate vulnerabilities and risks in real-time while the application is running in production. They buy the development teams the crucial time they need to resolve the underlying issue without service interruption or breach, ensuring that even if all other controls fail, we have a way to block and tackle in the critical moment. Runtime telemetry and risk-based alerting are the final checks on this coverage. This promotes a cultural change that enables engineers to take full ownership of their applications, from the initial line of code all the way to production. Security, in turn, achieves thorough, lasting coverage without becoming a bottleneck. This article is published as part of the Foundry Expert Contributor Network. Want to join?",

    "title": "Amazon Business Platform Security Flaw",
    "summary": "There is a platform logic gap where expired/revoked emails (post-termination) still authorize credit line extensions and charges without any employment validation prompt or automated flag. Let me demonstrate: In testing, an ex-employee (simulated via my own accounts) can pivot from a stale credential to drain costs undetected, scaling to thousands of SMBs. Happy to elaborate below for full repro— all on self-owned test accounts to stay in scope. ° Initial Account Setup (Exact Steps for Attacker/Ex-Employee to Gain Credit Line Access): This assumes a standard Amazon Business account (e.g., EIN-registered SMB with 6+ months history, as per approval norms). No special perms needed—defaults suffice. ° Create/Register Business Account: Log in as user at business.amazon.com with your work email (e.g., exemployee@company.com ) In my case, a spending limit was automatically issued. Initially a limit of $5k but bumped to $25k after I made personal purchases with my own card. ° Attacker Pivot (Post-Termination Access): Ex-employee logs in with cached/stale work email (no MFA re-prompt if session active) Navigate to \"Cart\" > Place purchase > Select \"Pay by Invoice/Credit Line.\" System grants access without validating current employment (e.g., no popup: \"Confirm active status?) Charge hits company account (e.g., $7k initial equipment purchases, after they ship, put in a 17k purchase after initial purchases get delivered), invoiced to ex employee email (not employer). ° Impact: Full unauthorized spend until manual dispute (avg. 30 days detection as per NET30 TERMS) PS: I had 8 days access to said account but no access to email, but still pulled it off ° Evidence for Scenario: Screenshots: 1) maxed out credit and credit line amount 2) Removal confirmation (email \"expired\" but login works) ° Analog Precedents: Echoes the Jan 2025 KeaBabies incident—$78M seller locked out via ex-access persistence, with charges rerouted before recovery. Public forums report similar (e.g., ex-employee account hijacks leading to $4K+ disputes). No PII touched—pure logic flow. This closes the eval loop. On mitigation: Tools like my Watchdogs Guardian v1.0 (autonomous agent at watchdogs.watch) already probe these gaps, learning session anomalies and auto-revoking on expiry signals. I would love Amazon's and Amazon Web Services (AWS) take on integrating similar autonomy. Thanks—excited to collaborate on hardening this.

I’ve always had the goal of eventually running my own startup — even if it’s something small in the beginning. For anyone who’s been in the industry longer: How realistic is it for someone early in their CYS journey to build a startup or small company in this field? I’m not talking about a vague “cyber startup.” I know the field is huge (pentesting, SOC services, automation tools, training, compliance platforms, etc.). I’m trying to understand what actual paths exist for beginners who want to eventually build something meaningful. I’d also appreciate honest insights on: What challenges new founders face in cybersecurity (credibility, competition, regulations, etc.). Which areas are more accessible for newcomers. And how building a cybersecurity startup differs from launching something in AI (barriers, trust, technical depth, market expectations). Just trying to get a grounded view before I commit to a long-term plan. Any experiences or advice would help. Thanks! submitted by /u/Sudden-Talk4972 [link] [comments]",

The future of digital security in South Africa will be shaped not only by technology but also by language, locality, and policy. This approach recognizes that effective cybersecurity in South Africa must be tailored to the country’s unique cultural and regulatory landscape, rather than simply importing solutions from abroad. Deputy Minister Mondli Gungubele , in his keynote address, noted the importance of viewing cybersecurity through the lens of local realities. He stressed that South Africa’s diverse linguistic, social, and policy contexts play a critical role in shaping how cyber threats are understood and addressed. “The challenges we face are global in reach, yet profoundly local in impact,” Gungubele noted, highlighting how transnational cybercrime exploits gaps in digital literacy, regulatory frameworks, and infrastructure access. Recent data from Cyble illustrates the urgency of this issue. Over the past six months, ransomware activity in South Africa has been concentrated among several prominent groups. NightSpire and INC Ransom emerged as the most active actors; each was linked to two documented incidents. (Source: Cyble Vision) Other groups, including Everest, BEAST, and CLOP, contributed to individual attacks, revealing a threat landscape marked by a mixture of new and established cybercriminal operations. These attacks targeted sectors ranging from government and law enforcement to education, healthcare, construction, and IT services, demonstrating that no sector is immune. Integrating Culture, Policy, and Technology The new South African cybersecurity strategy recognizes that traditional approaches, which often rely solely on technical defenses, are insufficient. Digital transformation is advancing across South Africa, with initiatives spanning e-government services, online education, fintech, and digital agriculture. While these developments offer opportunities for economic growth and inclusion, they also expand the attack surface, making cybersecurity a foundational concern rather than an optional add-on. A key feature of the strategy is its emphasis on cultural and contextual awareness. South Africa’s diversity means that one-size-fits-all cybersecurity campaigns are often ineffective. Language, communication norms, and local social structures all influence how individuals perceive risk and respond to threats. By incorporating cultural intelligence into cybersecurity policy, the country aims to foster a security posture that is both technically robust and socially adaptive. Aligning with Global Standards The strategy also stressed the need for stronger alignment with international standards. South Africa’s participation in the UN Cybercrime Treaty highlights a harmonized global response to transnational threats. The treaty establishes a shared legal framework for recognizing cybercrimes, facilitating international cooperation, and building capacity for nations that face resource constraints. For South Africa and the broader Global South, this represents an important step toward integrating African cybersecurity initiatives with global best practices. Digital literacy forms another pillar of the strategy. Evidence shows that human error accounts for a substantial proportion of security incidents. By equipping citizens and employees with the knowledge to identify phishing, malware , and disinformation, South Africa aims to create a human layer of defense that complements technological measures. Programs emphasizing digital ethics, risk awareness, and responsible online behavior will be essential in building a resilient cybersecurity culture. Working Together for a Stronger Cyber Defense Moreover, the strategy encourages a “triple helix” collaboration among government, industry, and academia. By pooling resources and perspectives, South Africa can accelerate research, threat intelligence sharing, and policy development. This new approach to cybersecurity in South Africa signals a departure from conventional, purely technical strategies. By integrating local realities, cultural awareness, and global cooperation, the strategy has the potential to redefine the country’s digital defense posture. Platforms like Cyble provide the right threat intelligence for strategies like these, helping organizations monitor new threats, assess vulnerabilities , and take proactive action.

Bundeskriminalamt Ermittlern aus Deutschland und der Schweiz ist ein Schlag gegen Online-Geldwäsche mit Kryptowährungen gelungen. Wie die Behörden mitteilten, wurde die Serverinfrastruktur eines sogenannten Bitcoin-Mixers beschlagnahmt und die Plattform erfolgreich abgeschaltet. Dabei wurden Kryptowährungen im Wert von umgerechnet rund 25 Millionen Euro sichergestellt. An den Ermittlungen waren die Generalstaatsanwaltschaft Frankfurt am Main, die Kantonsstaatanwaltschaft Zürich, das Bundeskriminalamt und Europol beteiligt, der Zugriff erfolgte laut Mitteilung am vergangenen Mittwoch. “Diese Operation ist ein weiterer, bedeutsamer Schritt bei der internationalen Bekämpfung von Online-Geldwäsche durch Krypto-Mixer”, sagte Vize-Präsidentin Bundeskriminalamt Martina Link. Großteil der getauschten Vermögenswerte “kriminellen Ursprungs” Die seit 2016 aktive Plattform cryptomixer.io sei zur Verschleierung von Finanzströmen genutzt worden, teilte das BKA mit. Dabei konnten Kryptowährungen anonym ein- und ausgezahlt werden. Es bestehe der dringende Verdacht, dass ein Großteil der dort getauschten Vermögenswerte kriminellen Ursprungs war, so das BKA. Den Betreibern wird daher gewerbsmäßige Geldwäsche sowie das Betreiben einer kriminellen Handelsplattform vorgeworfen. In der Schweiz wurden die Serverinfrastruktur, mehrere Mailaccounts beschlagnahmt und Datenmaterial als Beweismittel gesichert. (dpa/jm)",

    "title": "12 signs the CISO-CIO relationship is broken — and steps to fix it",
    "summary": "Despite the need for collaboration between security and IT, all is not well in the CISO-CIO relationship. And it’s not about newly minted CISOs trying to find their footing, as Gartner research has found that while around a third of CISOs with less than two years of experience report conflicts with their CIOs on key security-related areas, half of CISOs with five or more years of experience report conflicts in most of those same areas, including improving the organization’s cyber resilience and negotiating enterprise cyber risk appetite. Conflict can be a sign that the CIO-CISO relationship is broken, says Christine Lee , vice president of research and content leader for Gartner’s cybersecurity research team, but not always. In fact, other signs may be more telling indicators that the CIO and CISO are not working in concert, according to researchers, experienced executives, and executive advisors. Signs of trouble Security leaders and advisors offer CISOs the following signs that indicate there may be trouble worth addressing in their relationship with their CIO colleagues: 1. The CIO commonly disregards or overrides the CISO’s recommendations and decisions. Aimee Cardwell , CISO in residence at tech company Transcend and former CISO of UnitedHealth Group, says this situation often plays out with the CIO saying, “Thank you for your input, but we’re going to do what we want anyway.” 2. The CIO and CISO can’t resolve conflict. Conflict can be healthy for moving an organization forward. Diversity of perspectives and opinions can provide top executives with new possibilities and opportunities for compromise that benefit the organization overall. But if the CIO and CISO can’t resolve differences without escalating their disagreement to more senior executives, then a fundamental problem may be taking root. “Are you shoulder to shoulder or nose to nose? Because if you’re going nose to nose, then there’s misalignment,” Cardwell says. Gartner research notes that 87% of experienced CISOs describe their relationship with the CIO as “good” or “excellent” when it comes to resolving conflicts. Gartner’s Lee says this figure shows that conflict itself doesn’t mean the relationship is problematic. Rather, “it’s the inability to make progress or get to agreement that is a sign the CIO-CISO relationship is broken,” she says. 3. The CIO isn’t sharing information. “That’s a gigantic red flag,” Transcend’s Cardwell says. 4. The CIO alters or blocks the CISO’s message to the board. It’s problematic enough when the CISO doesn’t present directly to the board on a regular basis, but Cardwell says it’s even more troubling when the CIO is changing the information the CISO believes the board needs to have. “This goes beyond advice like, ‘You can word this a better way,’ or ‘You can tell the story in a better way.’ It’s not just the CIO coaching. It’s cutting facts that need to be elevated or making changes that could create a real moral problem for you as a CISO,” she explains. 5. The CIO otherwise undermines the CISO’s agenda to the board and other executives. “If the CIO is actively undermining the CISO’s credibility and opinions, if the CIO is mediating every conversation between the CISO and the board and executive team, that’s not a good sign,” Lee says. Trouble here also includes the CIO’s failure to advocate for the CISO’s priorities in important meetings and the organization’s IT strategy overall. 6. The CISO is not consulted on business initiatives involving IT. True partnership on any IT initiative would see the CIO and CISO working together from step one. But if the CISO is finding out about important tech initiatives late in the process or only by asking probing questions, it’s time to reset the relationship. “If someone says something about a new project or vendor or migration and the CISO doesn’t know something about it, then that’s a problem, because you’re then bolting on security,” says Dale Hoak , CISO for software firm RegScale. “In a good relationship, there are no surprises because you’re having continuous conversations and you’re sharing dashboards.” 7. There are no one-on-one conversations. LevelBlue CIO Maria Cardow says CIOs and CISOs who share information only via emails, through group meetings or between CIO and CISO subordinates (assuming that information will flow up) do not have a healthy rapport. “We have too much information in front of us to not be talking to each other directly; there is no substitute for conversations on a regular and on an ad-hoc basis,” she says. 8. The CIO and CISO don’t know each other’s priorities, challenges, strategies, etc. “As a CIO I should have a good idea of what my CISO’s concerns are and the CISO should know what’s going on in my world,” Cardow says. 9. The CISO and CIO clash on who should be doing what work. A similar sign of trouble is when one side blames the other for shortcomings in areas where they had joint responsibilities. 10. One buys technology with capabilities the other already has. This sign of trouble in the relationship goes both ways, but a related problem involves the CIO dictating the products the CISO must buy or the vendors or service providers the CISO must use. “In some cases those might be the right answer for security, but in some cases they might not be the right answer,” says Ayan Roy , EY’s Americas cybersecurity competency leader. “But just being told means there is not the right analysis being done. The CIO should give the CISO the latitude to pick the right solution; the CISO needs to be able to do the evaluation and to make the right pick.” 11. The CIO isn’t prioritizing cyber hygiene. One of the most common indications here is failing to or foregoing patching vulnerabilities that the security team has identified and prioritized for remediation. 12. Technology products are commonly released with security flaws or control gaps. “The question then is, ‘Why didn’t we figure that out during the product design lifecycle,’ and the answer is usually poor collaboration between IT and security,” says Sara Madden , CISO of Convera, a global payments and foreign exchange company. The CIO-CISO relationship matters The CIO and CISO need to have a strong relationship for either of them to succeed, says MK Palmore , founder and principal adviser for advisory firm Apogee Global RMS and a former director in the Office of the CISO at Google Cloud. “It’s critical that those in these two positions get along with each other, and that they’re not only collegial but collaborative,” he says. Yes, they each have their own domain and their own set of tasks and objectives, but the reality is that each one cannot get that work done without the other. “So they have to rely on one another, and they have to each recognize that they must rely on each other.” Moreover, it’s not just the CIO and CISO who suffer when they aren’t collegial and collaborative. Palmore and other experts say a poor CIO-CISO relationship also has a negative impact on their departments and the organization as a whole. “A strained CIO-CISO relationship often shows up as misalignment in goals, priorities, or even communication,” says Marnie Wilking , CSO at Booking.com. “When technology and security leaders are not on the same page, it becomes clear in both operations and outcomes, from missed project deadlines to increased vulnerabilities.” Multiple factors can contribute to a strained relationship. To start, the security department is still sometimes seen as — and acts like — the department of “no,” Cardwell says. “The CIO never has the luxury of saying ‘no.’ The CIO’s job is to enable what the business is trying to do. So the CISO needs to have that mindset, too: ‘The business wants to do this thing, and my job is to figure out how to make that possible,’” she explains. Even if security doesn’t act like the department of “no,” Cardwell says, it may take the CISO too long to get to “yes.” “There are a hundred ways, depending on what the problem is, to solve the problem quickly,” she says. “As a CISO, I like to provide several solutions with different price points and timelines with pros and cons and security scores, from fastest on or least secure or most secure on this timeline, to give the CIO and the business options.” Another reason for a poor relationship: Sometimes the CIO doesn’t place a high enough priority on security. “Maybe the CISO is only security-minded but not thinking as a business-enabler; or maybe the CIO isn’t at all security-minded and only focused on business enablement,” Palmore says. In other cases, the CIO wants tight control of all things IT and excludes security — or vice versa. “Some security leaders believe that they alone own security and find themselves on an island without a boat to get them home,” says Kory Daniels , chief security and trust officer at LevelBlue, a managed security services provider. Other factors that can lead to a poor CIO-CISO relationship are more structural, experts say. It may be that the organization has not defined each position’s responsibilities. “When roles and responsibilities aren’t clearly defined, overlaps or gaps in accountability can create unnecessary risk,” Wilking says. Or it could be that the organization’s funding process turns them into “adversaries for the same dollar,” Cardow says. Much of these problems stem from what Wilking says is “a lack of shared context and alignment around enterprise risk.” “The CIO is typically measured on uptime, scalability, and agility, while the CISO is focused on protecting data, ensuring compliance, and mitigating threats. Without a unified view of how those priorities intersect, the two can seem at odds,” she explains. “Too often, cybersecurity gets treated like the gatekeeper instead of a true partner. Teamwork ends up feeling transactional instead of collaborative. At Booking.com we emphasize embedding cybersecurity into business strategy from the start, ensuring it’s part of every conversation about product design, data, and customer trust.” How to improve a poor relationship CIOs and CISOs both have incentives to improve a problematic relationship. As Lee explains, “The CIO-CISO relationship is critical. They both have to partner effectively to achieve the organization’s technology and cybersecurity goals. All tech comes with cybersecurity exposure that can impact the successful implementation of the tech and business outcomes; that’s why CIOs have to care about cybersecurity. And CISOs have to know that cybersecurity exists to achieve business outcomes. So they have to work together to achieve each other’s priorities.” CISOs can take steps to develop a better rapport with their CIOs, using the disruption happening today — whether from AI or the uncertainty in the economy — as an opportunity to check in, reset the relationship, and address any issues that have stymied collaboration. Steps for CISOs include: Establishing alignment with the CIO as well as members of the C-suite and the board on the organization’s position on risk. Ensuring security is aligned with the organization’s strategy and its IT roadmap. Transcend’s Cardwell says it’s important for CISOs to think, “The CIO has a great thing here. I’d like to find how to make it secure.” Getting clarity on CIO and CISO responsibilities. “You need clarity on where the lines are drawn,” LevelBlue’s Daniels says. Making regular and ad hoc direct communication with the CIO a priority. Focusing on relationship management. “Communicate, be willing to meet, get teams to meet, establish trust,” Daniels says. Seeking to understand the CIO’s priorities, incentives, and challenges and sharing yours. “Find a way to walk a mile in the other’s shoe,” Daniels adds. Shifting to a business-enablement mindset. “Instead of leading with ‘no,’ lead with ‘How do we get there securely,’” RegScale CISO Hoak says.",

    "title": "Implementing and Managing an ADCS Offline Root Certificate Authority (Part 1)",
    "summary": "My name is Ron Arestia, and I am a Security Researcher with Microsoft’s Detection and Response Team (DART). We respond to customer cybersecurity incidents to assist with containment and recovery from threat actors. In this blog post, we will be covering the basics of implementing an Active Directory Certificate Services (ADCS) offline root Certificate Authority (CA) and how to manage it securely. This is the first in a series of follow up posts to my original article reviewing Secure Configuration and Hardening of Active Directory Certificate Services . In Part 1 of our series, we will focus on some high-level security discussions around your offline root certificate authority before you even begin installing the operating system. Secure Source, Secure Start Confidence in your PKI begins with a secure source Are you familiar with the concept of a “secure source?” The term itself might seem a bit nebulous, so let’s unpack the concept contextually with general understanding and expand to Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). In the larger context of “zero trust,” think of secure source as generally meaning a trusted publisher of some set of data such as software. Microsoft publishes the Windows operating system, and the binaries for those operating systems are available from locations such as the Volume Licensing portal or Visual Studio Enterprise. Each download is published with a corresponding SHA hash. Why? If you use a tool like Get-FileHash in PowerShell against the downloaded binary, it will output a hash of the file that is unique to the data therein. The software publisher, Microsoft in this case, has gone through this same process prior to publishing to verify that the data in the binary has not changed. You can use any hashing tool to check your file integrity the same way: This file is identical to the file published by Microsoft, and it can be considered a true source as published. If the source file was manipulated in transit or after download, the hashes would not be the same. Using more complex hashing algorithms, such as SHA256, provides greater confidence that the file has not been manipulated, and thus, you can trust that this is the operating system published by Microsoft. This is a secure source file. Using this source ISO ensures that you are using a true copy of the Windows operating system as provided by Microsoft. This can be extended to any modern operating system available for download (e.g., Linux). Now that you have a secure source file, take a look at your hardware. Are you going to use a physical server to house your root certificate authority (CA)? Or are you going to install the root CA as a virtual machine (VM) on an existing hypervisor? If you’re using a physical server, is the platform brand new from a trusted distributor, or are you piecing together a platform from spare parts? In the interest of secure source, I’d recommend you defer to the former, but if you’re confident in your spare parts inventory, you can use a previous platform with the caveat that you update all of the applicable firmware on either the new platform or the old. Why? Physical servers by major distributors such as Cisco, Dell, and HP are a complex set of hardware platforms including power management, remote access controllers, disk controllers, and mainboards. Since the physical server isn’t currently in use, it’s the best time to update all of the firmware and prepare all of the most up-to-date software drivers for your installation to ensure common platform security issues are patched to current. A truly offline CA likely won’t suffer a catastrophic security compromise but taking pains to update your architecture prior to its implementation is the best strategy to ensure you aren’t scrambling to secure your platforms under duress in the future. As with the operating system, make sure you are comparing hashes for all of your firmware and software updates and documenting those hashes for future security or compliance audits. If you are planning to implement an offline root CA on a virtualization platform, you are necessarily expanding your risk footprint unless you are installing the root CA virtual machine (VM) on a tier 0 hypervisor with strict access controls. Why? As discussed in my first post in this series, and as we will discuss later, the private key of your root CA is the most important logical piece of information for your public key infrastructure (PKI). Protection of the private key is tantamount to every other operation for your PKI. If your private key lives on the local disk of your server, who has access to that hard drive? In a virtual environment, you’re sharing physical disks with other servers. Are your VM infrastructure engineers trusted? If a threat actor compromises the account of one of those engineers, they could easily exfiltrate the VMDK or VHDX of your offline root and have their way with the private key for your root CA. Consider it best practice, when virtualizing your root CA, that the virtual machine live on a dedicated tier 0 hypervisor with limited, controlled access. If you have a dedicated platform for your other tier 0 assets, your root CA can live therein with the proper controls in place. If you don’t have a tier 0 hypervisor, you still have options. On a trusted workstation such as a secure/privileged access workstation (SAW or PAW) running Windows, you can install the Hyper-V role and setup a VM to run the offline root CA. In my experience, you still want to secure and segregate the disk, so installing a dedicated disk using a USB disk controller or even just a thumb drive to house your root CA installation is preferred. This also gives you the ability to lock the physical disk in a fire safe to control physical access to the private key. It’s also possible to take a physical desktop or laptop slated for decommissioning giving it a new life as your root CA. This physical system can be locked in a secure location for safekeeping the same as the hard drive in the previous example albeit requiring more physical space which is why we usually see customers using a USB drive on a trusted system to run the root CA. The length of time required for this system to be setup, perform the required signing operations, and shutdown for safekeeping should be less than a day. All of these ideas are tangential to the conversation of secure source, but it’s important to note that the secure source mentality should extend to the hardware you choose to use for your offline root CA. For instance, you would never use a laptop that was previously removed from inventory under suspicion of housing malware. Even if you completely wiped the disk, replaced the RAM, updated the UEFI/BIOS, there’s still a non-zero chance that the platform isn’t safe. Security of your offline root CA platform should be top-of-mind in every decision made. Finally, your root CA installation and setup should follow a clean source/clean keyboard mentality all the way through to go live. The system should never be attached to a network in any way. (This introduces some complications in a virtualization environment even if you never connect a virtual adapter to the VM; the hypervisor itself is connected to some network, introducing some risk even on a sanitized tier 0 platform.) If you’re not leveraging a hardware security module (HSM) for the private key, the disk should be completely sequestered from any environment where any untrusted identity could access it or any of its ephemeral existence (i.e., backups, checkpoints, snapshots). And you want to ensure that you have dedicated but secure access to console to manipulate the operating system during setup and for future use. This should include a strategy to move certificate signing requests (CSRs), certificate revocation lists (CRLs), and authority information access (AIA) data such as the root and issuing CA certificates to and from the new root CA. The Private Key (Why You Should Be Using HSM) The most important logical piece of your PKI should not be on disk I want to impress upon our customers the importance of the idea that the root certificate authority (CA) private key is the most important logical piece of information for your public key infrastructure (PKI). What does this mean? Think of the private key for your root CA as the key to the front door of your home. If you own your home, you are the sole responsible party for the safety of that key. If you purchased a brand-new home, you’re likely the only person who has that key. You will be very prescriptive with whom you share that key. Your spouse or significant other, responsible members of your immediate family, maybe even close friends or neighbors will have a copy of that key to help you maintain or watch over your home while you’re away or for your safety if you live alone. If you purchase a pre-owned home, you will likely prioritize changing the locks of your new home, because you don’t know the people who might have a copy of that old key, and you will distribute that new key to individuals named previously. You should feel safe and secure in your own home. Similar to the key to your home, the private key of your root CA should be safeguarded with the same zeal. If the private key of your root CA is in the hands of an individual or entity outside of your knowledge or control, the ability to sign certificates and certificate revocation lists (CRLs) is not exclusively under your control. If you’re not scrutinizing who is in your enterprise environment, anyone with a copy of that key could stand up a root CA, grab a copy of your root CA certificate, and use those two pieces of data to create certificates that look and act the same as certificates issued by your legitimate, known root CA. They can also generate CRLs that could be accepted as legitimate by your existing PKI sans certificates that you might have revoked for any reason. If every system in your enterprise trusts a single root CA, and that single root CA now exists as a rogue system in your environment, there’s nothing to prevent a threat actor from masquerading as a legitimate purveyor of certificates in your environment: server authentication certificates, user authentication/smart card certificates, and even code signing or trusted publisher certificates. The private key is the single most important logical piece of data for your PKI. This data is stored by default on the system drive in your Windows Active Directory Certificate Services (ADCS) CA. A simple Internet search will reveal common locations for this key, so I will not publish that through this forum in deference to security. Using certutil, however, you can backup the private key of your root CA, and it will exist on the local hard disk available to anyone with access to that system programmatically or physically through ownership of the disk or partition. (This includes via access to a virtual disk under virtual infrastructure.) Keeping the private key on the local hard disk of your root CA is akin to leaving your house key under your door mat. Is it safe there? Maybe, but there’s a non-zero chance that an untrusted person could simply lift the mat and gain access to your home. Keeping your root CA truly offline is arguably a better strategy and critical if you do not plan to implement a hardware security module (HSM). To continue with the house key analogy: it’s merely a clever way to obfuscate the key like one of those hide-a-key decorative rocks or placing the key in a more obscure location like under a sprinkler donut. So why should you invest in a hardware security module (HSM)? The most common reason to not use HSM is cost, but several retail companies provide USB HSM devices for under US$1,000 which makes the availability much more financially viable for small businesses. For larger businesses, I would recommend enterprise-class hardware usually in the form of a tamper-resistant rackmount device with some sort of authorization to access the data thereon, ideally through the use of multifactor authentication (MFA). Cloud providers such as Microsoft are also providing HSM-as-a-service (HSMaaS) with comprehensive integration capabilities you should also investigate if you are a cloud-only enterprise or looking to reduce your on-premises datacenter footprint. The HSM is a standalone platform dedicated to performing complex cryptographic operations such as random number generation, key generation, encryption and decryption, signing, and hashing. By offloading these operations to a dedicated platform, you are reducing the need to perform them on individual servers, possibly saving you processor time on individual servers and centralizing cryptographic operations on a secure platform that is physically and logically hardened against attackers. A driver and application programming interface (API) are used by the dependent system, such as your certificate or registration authorities, to perform key generation and access without exposing the key information. In the case of your offline root CA, this means that the generation of your private key and signing of certificate signing requests (CSRs) and certificate revocation lists (CRLs) with that key are not performed by the CA itself but through an interface to the HSM whereupon those operations are performed safely and the generated outputs passed to the CA for further operations. Since the private key never exists on the root CA in any form, the ability for a threat actor to gain access to this critical data is impossible. Note: HSMs are cryptographic devices subject to export controls. It’s possible that your country has strict regulations for these devices. Please familiarize yourself with your state or national laws concerning these devices and make choices appropriate for your enterprise. Without the private key of your root CA or any of your registration authorities (RA) or subordinate/issuing CAs, even the most advanced persistent threats would find it impractical to even try to masquerade as the same or perform any trusted cryptographic operations in your environment. They would move on to other high value targets in your environment not otherwise entangled with your PKI. One last important note: implementing HSMs in your environment does not negate the need for your root CA to be truly offline nor does it abrogate any of your administrative responsibilities to best practice adherence. They are advanced tools designed to provide a high level of assurance for your organization’s cryptographic operations, and as with any tool, there are avenues for misuse, misconfiguration, and abuse without proper training and diligence. Consult your Microsoft and HSM professionals for guidance on how to integrate HSM into your organization. Whether you’re starting fresh with PKI or you have a mature implementation, HSM should be considered universally for any security practitioner. That’s going to conclude Part 1 of our series on securing your ADCS offline root CA. In Part 2 we will discuss guidelines for CRL and AIA publishing and common root CA deployment scenarios.",

Das können die meisten Unternehmen nicht so einfach intern umsetzen”, meint Gyan Chawdhary , Gründer und CEO des Cybersecurity-Schulungsanbieters Kontra. Ein MSSP könne sowohl Bedrohungen frühzeitig erkennen als auch gewährleisten, dass auf Vorfälle eine schnelle Reaktion folge, so der Manager. Dabei sollten Sicherheitsentscheider nicht nur auf Tools achten , sondern auch auf “weiche” Faktoren, rät Chawdhary: “Was wirklich zählt, sind Erfahrung, Zuverlässigkeit und die Kommunikationsfähigkeit eines MSSP. Sie brauchen einen Anbieter, der Ihre Branche versteht, schnell reagiert, wenn etwas schief geht, und transparent darüber informiert, was er tut und warum.” Der CEO warnt jedoch, dass MSSPs zwar im Umgang mit technischen Problemen und Bedrohungen versiert sind, aber nicht alles lösen können: “Eine schwache Sicherheitskultur , schlechte interne Richtlinien oder Insider-Bedrohungen liegen oft außerhalb ihrer Kontrolle.” 2. Lähmende Warnmeldungen Wenn Ihr SOC-Team täglich 300 Warnmeldungen ignoriert und manuell triagiert, ist das ein deutliches Zeichen dafür, dass Sie einen Managed Security Service Provider in Betracht ziehen sollten. Das sieht auch Toby Basalla , Gründer und Principal Data Consultant bei Synthelize, so. “Wenn Chaos herrscht, wer weiß dann noch, welche Red Flags wirklich ernst zu nehmen sind? Sie würden wahrscheinlich auch nicht Daten rund um die Uhr ohne Redundanz verarbeiten. Mit Blick auf Security verhält es sich nicht anders.” 3. Brandbekämpfung First Wenn sich das interne Team nicht nur schwer damit tut, Alerts zu bewältigen, sondern auch damit, zeitnah auf Vorfälle zu reagieren oder mit den Compliance-Anforderungen Schritt zu halten, ist das ebenfalls ein Warnsignal für akuten MSSP-Bedarf. Ensar Seker , CISO beim Sicherheitsanbieter SOCRadar, erläutert, welche Folgen in so einem Fall drohen: “Wenn interne Teams von der schieren Menge der operativen Aufgaben überwältigt sind und sich nicht auf die strategische Verteidigung konzentrieren können, ist Burnout unausweichlich.” Laut Seker sollten Unternehmen, die MSSPs evaluieren vor allem auf Erfahrung, Transparenz und Integrationsbereitschaft achten: “Suchen Sie nach Anbietern, die detaillierte SLAs, Echtzeit-Transparenz bei Warnmeldungen, klare Eskalationswege und native Integrationen bieten. Ebenso wichtig ist eine enge kulturelle und kommunikative Abstimmung. Der MSSP muss sich wie eine Erweiterung Ihres Teams anfühlen, nicht wie eine Black Box.” 4. Keine internen Ressourcen Viele kleinere Unternehmen können es sich schlicht nicht leisten, ein Team von Cybersicherheitsspezialisten in Vollzeit zu beschäftigen. Das macht diese Firmen besonders anfällig für sämtliche Arten von Cyberangriffen. Einen Managed Security Service Provider zu engagieren, bietet einen Ausweg aus dieser Situation, wie Trevor Young , Chief Product Officer bei Security Compass, erklärt: “MSSPs können Skaleneffekte, proaktive Threat Intelligence und ein tiefgehendes Verständnis der Security Best Practices bieten.” Der größte Fehler, den Unternehmen bei der Suche nach einem MSSP machen können, ist nach Meinung des Produktentscheiders, das als rein kostenorientierte Entscheidung zu betrachten. Weitere häufige Fehler sind laut Young in diesem Zusammenhang, sämtliche Sicherheits-Tasks an einen MSSP auszulagern, ohne zuvor eine ordnungsgemäße Due Diligence durchzuführen: “Unternehmen versäumen es oft, ihre Sicherheitsanforderungen, die erwarteten Ergebnisse und den Umfang der Dienstleistungen klar zu definieren. Das führt zu falschen Erwartungen und unzureichendem Schutz.” 5. Interner Wissensmangel Wenn ein internes Team immer wieder auf Fragen stößt, die es nicht einhundertprozentig beantworten kann, ist es möglicherweise ebenfalls an der Zeit, die Hilfe eines Managed Security Provider in Anspruch zu nehmen. “Selbst wenn nur in einem oder zwei Cybersecurity-Bereichen spezifisches Wissen fehlt, kann das zu erheblichen Versäumnissen führen und das Potenzial für Effizienzsteigerungen verringern”, hält Aimee Simpson , Director beim Sicherheitsanbieter Huntress, fest. In Simpsons Erfahrung können insbesondere kleine IT-Teams in vielen Fällen bereits mit grundlegenden Cybersicherheitsaufgaben überlastet sein. “Ein MSSP kann Ihr Team entlasten, sodass es sich darauf konzentrieren kann, die IT-Sicherheit zu optimieren, statt sie nur aufrechtzuerhalten.” 6. Kein Schutz nach Feierabend Für Unternehmen, die nach einer 24/7-Sicherheitslösung suchen, bietet ein Managed Security Service Provider eine praktische und in der Regel erschwingliche Komplettlösung. “Der Umfang der Betreuung, die ein MSSP bietet, stellt an sich bereits eine erhebliche Verbesserung der Sicherheitslage dar”, meint Huntress-Managerin Simpson. CPO Young empfiehlt an dieser Stelle: “Suchen Sie nach einem MSSP, der eine umfassende Palette von Dienstleistungen anbietet und der sich dazu verpflichtet, neuen Bedrohungen einen Schritt voraus zu sein.” 7. Schmerzhaftes Reporting “Reportings stellen für viele Unternehmen einen erheblichen Mehraufwand dar”, konstatiert Tony Anscombe , Chief Security Evangelist beim Sicherheitsdienstleister ESET. Insbesondere Unternehmen, die aufgrund ihres Standortes einer Meldepflicht von Cybervorfällen unterliegen, müssten unter Umständen ganze Teams beschäftigen, um die damit zusammenhängenden Reporting-Tasks abdecken zu können. “Diese Belastung lässt sich wahrscheinlich am effizientesten durch einen Managed Security Service Provider oder ein externes Cyber-Incident-Response-Team bewältigen, das mit den spezifischen Berichtsmethoden und -anforderungen vertraut ist”, meint der Sicherheitsexperte. Darüber hinaus ist Anscombe der Ansicht, dass ein gutes MSSP-Paket neben Meldepflichten und Reportings auch einen Incident-Response-Plan und regelmäßiges Security-Testing umfassen sollte: “So lässt sich sicherzustellen, dass Patches und Software-Updates schnell und effektiv angewendet werden.” (fm) Sie wollen weitere interessante Beiträge rund um das Thema IT-Sicherheit lesen?

    "title": "Security Implications of Reverse Proxy Placement",
    "summary": "Hello cyber folks! Curious of the community’s thoughts on a thought experiment i’ve been having: Say I have a reverse proxy (RP) on my network brokering a service i’m running. I see 3 deployment options: Use two separate physical servers. One to run the RP, and another to run the service. Connected via a layer-2 switch, router-on-a-stick, and upstream firewall. Use a hypervisor, run the RP on the same physical server as the service, but each within their own VM. Use containers, run the RP & service on the same physical server & OS (baremetal Debian for example) and use a docker bridge network to connect the two. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ In terms of security, i think 1 is the best, 2 is almost identical to 1 except for the threat of VM escape, and 3 is the least secure but potentially still production-viable if configured properly. I’d love to hear your thoughts on what’s best and the security implications of each. Also if you’d change anything about the deployment options above! Thanks!! submitted by /u/TheCmenator [link] [comments]",
